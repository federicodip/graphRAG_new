It thus may give a new impulse to the still open discussion about the appearance of Hellenistic swords starting from the period of Alexander's Successors.The weapon can have been used by soldiers of the late Ptolemaic period as well as by members of the Roman army.The question whether the sword ended up in the temenos as part of local defensive arms or as a votive object will largely remain speculative, as its find context is not stratigraphically reliable.

It is located in a desert area, north of Lake Qarun, and its function was mainly religious and commercial (Fig. 1).Archaeological evidence attests to the presence in this area of settlements, tombs and other features datable from the Neolithic to Islamic periods.The local landscape has undergone several drastic changes during this long period of time, from a wet to a hyper-arid environment.However, there is a strong possibility that one of the reasons for a new foundation or refoundation of a settlement at the beginning of the Hellenistic period was the presence of a revered sanctuary on top of a natural hill. In fact, below the Hellenistic period temple dedicated to the god Soknopaios, features of a previous phase have been found but not yet precisely dated.2#p1At the end of the Ptolemaic period or beginning of the Roman period the temple was renovated and the dromos restored and extended toward the south, probably twice.Also the settlement was enlarged and the houses aggregated in blocks to accommodate an increase of the population. The abandonment of the kome is dated to the mid-third century AD, but the reasons are so far unknown.However, people returned to live in the temenos area between the fourth and the seventh century.#p2The archaeological excavation carried on by the Soknopaiou Nesos Project is mainly concentrated in the temple area, where no previous scientific work was carried out.The sacred area, dedicated to the god Soknopaios, is enclosed by a temenos wall (ca. 88 x 125 m) and is in general quite well preserved across its elements, i.e., the main temple, chapels, houses and service buildings. Despite natural erosion, the spoliation of the limestone blocks and illicit excavations, the temenos area is an interesting context to study and one of the better preserved in the Fayyum (Fig. 2). A considerable number of papyri has been found by treasure hunters in the temple precinct at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth; these are now preserved in several collections. Basalt statues were also found in a good state of preservation, but it is not clear where they were found, whether inside the temenos or on the dromos, the ceremonial road that crosses the settlement from north to south and connected the temple with the edge of the town.3#p3Topographic and geophysical surveys have been carried out in the settlement during the regular excavation seasons; these have allowed a better knowledge of the archaeological site. Two methods have been followed in the geophysical survey,4 magnetometry and electrical resistivity, but they did not produce the expected results because the difference in the magnetic fields of the materials used in the buildings and the sand that covers them is too small.However, it was possible to establish the presence of buildings buried by sand and debris in different areas, and of some highly magnetic zones. These can be interpreted mainly as ovens or fireplaces in domestic buildings, but two strong positive peaks suggested the presence of anomalous materials.One of these is located in Area 1 of the geophysical survey, which is located inside the temenos (Fig. 3, Fig. 4), west of building ST 20 under excavation.The anomaly revealed the presence at a shallow depth (calculated between 50 and 80 cm) of an object about 1 meter long, south of the standing walls of a building (labelled ST 21) built with local stone and mud brick and with the same technique as the Ptolemaic temple ST 18. Our first hypothesis for the interpretation of the magnetic anomaly was the presence of a basalt statue, which would have been a common occurrence in a temple area.It was then decided to open a new sector in building ST 21 to verify this supposition.In fact, the finding of a statue in context would have probably shed new light on those found in the past and of which the place of discovery is still unknown. However, the magnetic anomaly turned out to be something completely unexpected for a temple context: a complete iron sword (ST06/338/1474+2557) (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) Its first appearance was of extreme fragility, and thus we operated with a first consolidation before starting its removal and transfer to the Supreme Council of Antiquities general storehouse at Kom Aushim.Aly Taha Omar, from the Egyptian-Italian Center for Restoration and Archaeology in Cairo, consolidated the sword and the sand below it with sprayed paraloid and prepared a wooden box for its transportation (Fig. 7). In 2008 Mohammed Ahmed, a freelance conservator, removed the paraloid and proceeded with the cleaning and consolidation of the sword.The rusted iron that covered completely the object turned out to be from the scabbard and not from the blade, which is perfectly preserved, along with the final part of the scabbard, where the iron sheet is thicker than in its upper part.Every iron piece has been maintained and consolidated. The ebony pommel did not need any treatment and is still very solid and unchanged.In contrast, the padding of the grip made with a red textile was found in very fragile condition and only partly preserved.It has also been treated in order to preserve it to the maximum extent possible.In 2012 a series of X-ray images was taken in the storehouse by means of an old portable X-ray machine from Medinet el-Fayyum.5 The results, however, are not useful for a detailed study of the manufacture of the object. At present the sword and all its related pieces are stored in a wooden box, with foam supports shaped to fit, in the SCA general storehouse of Kom Aushim (Fayyum); they are registered in the SCA official register as no. 159 The archaeological context (Davoli) .The trench, called Saggio 1, was initially 4 x 3 m; it was then enlarged to 10 x 6 m to cover the area of building ST 21, which was only partially visible at the beginning of the excavation. The area had a slope down toward the east and was covered by sand mixed with mud brick debris in varying concentrations. n nThe excavation was limited to the surface layers that covered the upper part of the subterranean rooms of ST 21.In fact, the building is almost completely destroyed in its ground floor, and only parts of the north walls survive.It is actually composed of two structures built in two different phases: the most ancient one is called ST 21 I, while the most recent is ST 21 II (Fig. 8, Fig. 9, and Fig. 10). The two buildings seem to have been part of one structure, of which only part of the underground rooms and walls survives.In fact, the south wall 339 seems to be part of the second phase (ST 21 II).The technique and building materials are different and not uniformly used: the walls of the underground rooms are built in mud brick, while the perimeter walls are made with a mixed technique, with rough slabs of local brown limestone at the base and mud brick on top. n nSeven underground rooms have been recognized, of which at least five were originally covered with barrel vaults, all oriented north u2013south and made in mud brick. The exploration of these rooms has been postponed till after the end of the excavation of the main temple ST 20, for logistical reasons. n nRoom A (2.0 x 0.90 m) was a cellar, accessible through a shaft located in the southeast corner, and was originally covered by a vault. n nRoom B (2.5 x 0.80 m) was a L-shaped cellar covered by a vault, and with the entrance shaft probably located northwest of it. n nRoom C (2.10 m long) is a cellar with its original vault completely preserved. This is covered with part of the mud-brick floor of the upper room.The entrance vertical shaft is at its north side and is still well preserved (53 x 45 cm). n nRoom D (1.70 x 0.64 m) was also a barrel-vaulted cellar, but its north end is not preserved. n nThe central, irregular space G was probably not a cellar but only a space full of sand in the foundations of the building.The sword and a castanet half were found on top of it. The sword was lying 80 cm north of the stone wall ST06/339 and immediately to the east of the vault of room C (ST06/374). n nRooms E and F are part of the second phase building (ST 21 II). E was a cellar (1.70 x 0.90 m) with a sort of niche on its east wall, while it is not clear if room F (1.48 x 0.92 m) was used as a cellar or if it was a space in the foundations. n nThe stratigraphy covering the building (average thickness 60 cm) is unreliable, and the objects in it are certainly not in their original contexts.6 The surface deposits were made of wind-blown sand and debris (ST06/336),7 and of a concentration of mud bricks (ST06/337). These two units covered a layer of sand with mud brick rubble and organic materials, such as seeds of different fruits (ST06/338) and straw.In the surface layers ST06/336 and 337 a broken pottery statuette (ST06/336/1395),8 three bronze coins, including one of Ptolemy VI (ST06/336/1447) and two drachmae of Antoninus Pius (ST06/336/1455, 1456),9 a fragment of a capital made in plaster (ST06/337/1419), a wooden bolt (ST06/337/1729), a complete lamp (ST06/337/1587),10 and a blue glass bead (ST06/337/1755) have been found. The iron sword, with a knob in ebony (ST06/338/1474) and the terminal part of the scabbard (ST06/338/2557), was found lying horizontally oriented north u2013south, at an elevation of 26 m asl (Figs. 5, Fig. 6).It seems an artificial deposition, at about 50 cm below the surface, but a depositional pit cutting DSU ST06/338 has not been recognized.Other items found in the same DSU are a fragment of a wooden seal (ST06/338/1390), an iron blade of a knife (ST06/338/1462), a bronze needle (ST06/338/1472), an illegible coin (ST06/338/1473), a wooden knob for a box (ST06/338/1479), a wood castanet half (ST06/338/1688),11 and a bead in blue fa u00efence (ST06/338/1751). n nIII. The sword (Ch.Miks)12 n n1.Description of the find n nThe sword (ST06/0338/1474) was found near structure ST 21, which was revealed in Saggio 1 (season 2006).At the time of the deposition, it was still stuck within its scabbard (ST06/0338/2557).Unfortunately, despite the arid climate the preservation of all components of the weapon was not good enough to conserve them permanently in their original position. Even upon restoration a certain reduction of material is to be observed.The following analysis essentially draws upon the blade with the pommel and parts of the grip as well as remains of metal components of the suspension and the lower end of the sword scabbard (Fig. 11). n nWith the exception of a few nicks, the iron blade is fully preserved.It weighs around 1.3 kg (including the pommel and grip). From the point to the remains of the peened over/riveted end of the tang it measures 945 mm, consisting of the 172 mm long tang, 13.7 mm wide at its lower end, and the 773 mm long blade.The latter is characterized by slightly declining shoulders and waisted contours, that is to say, a partially arched indentation in the course of both cutting edges, and an extremely long point.Accordingly, its width changes significantly. It reaches 58 mm at the shoulders, 41.9 mm at the waist and 56.8 mm again at the transition to the point.The cross-section of the blade is of a flattened rhombic shape with a clearly accentuated central ridge.The strength of the blade along this central ridge also varies from 7.8 mm at the start of the tang, which demonstrates a rectangular cross-section, to 5.5 mm at the transition to the point of the blade. A particular local thickening of the point is not found. Its final area is once more accented by a slight kink in the blade u2019s edges.Without a metallographic analysis we cannot attempt any conclusions on the forging technological composition of the blade.Neither an optical nor an X-ray survey, the latter realized in adverse circumstances, yielded structures which might suggest the composition of different iron/steel elements with potentially varying degrees of hardness.13 n nThe single entirely preserved element of the former hilt is a dominant pommel, which remains applied to the end of the tang of the sword (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). According to Davoli, it is made of a piece of ebony.It is 95.7 mm wide, 81.7 mm high and 66 mm deep.Deep indentations divide its body clearly.Basically, the central design element is a ball, which sits on a central base protruding to its front and rear.At the same time, each side has an u201cinserted u201d, or annexed, cylindrical or spindle-shaped element.The pommel is vertically drilled through with a conical drill hole that allows it to be slid onto the tang. On its bottom side, the shape of the drill hole is adjusted to the rectangular cross-section of the sword u2019s tang, which is still around 8.5 mm wide at the point of entrance (Fig. 12.3).At the point at which it exits on the top of the pommel, the end of the tang is peened over to a mushroom-shaped mere approximately 6.5 mm wide and about 3 mm high, through which all of the hilt parts of the sword would formerly have been fixed to the tang to prevent them from slipping (Fig. 12.2). The fact that the rivet head lacks an additional metal plate to ensure a sufficient pressure of the riveting denotes the density and hardness of the wood of which the pommel was made. n nParts of the grip immediately below the pommel had originally been preserved (Fig. 12.1).They did not consist of firm hilt plates or of a grip sleeve but of a red textile, which was wrapped tightly around the tang as a thick bundle. When the sword was found, it remained on three of the four tang sides with an approximate length of 61.5 mm.In contrast to the length, the width discernible at the time of about 29 mm and the depth/width (including the tang) of a maximum of ca. 27 mm, will have been quite close to the original dimensions of the grip. n nThe well preserved sword blade and pommel stand in stark contrast to the scanty remains of the scabbard (ST06/0338/2557). The best-preserved fragment is a 215 mm long piece of a metal binding of the lower end of the scabbard (Fig. 11, 13).This constitutes the parts of two channel-shaped edge bindings made of a 2 mm thick iron sheet.In the area of the former point of the scabbard they are merged within the nozzle-shaped neck of a separately manufactured spherical terminal knob (diameter 20 mm) with a horizontal groove all around. The internal width of the binding u2019s channel is 14.5 mm at the most and conveys a vague idea of the thickness of the former organic scabbard body at its lower end.The organic parts of the scabbard have disappeared, and therefore it is not possible to determine what material it was made of.Given the dimensions of the binding u2019s channel, however, the scabbard could very well have been supported by a thinner wooden body. Numerous metal fragments, which the restoration process separated from the blade, could indicate that the edge binding once continued above the area of the scabbard u2019s point, and thus that once a complete scabbard frame may have existed (Fig. 11.1).Among these there are four 22 mm wide strip-like fragments of 2 mm thick iron sheet, possibly originating from horizontal frame- or carrying-clamps (suspension bands). The remains of four simple iron rings (diameter 19 mm) further indicate the former existence of a corresponding suspension of the scabbard.They are made of 3.5 mm strong rod material with circular cross-section. n n2.The blade n nThe waisted blade of the sword with its long extended point doubtless places the present weapon alongside comparably shaped Roman or at least Roman-influenced swords from find contexts of the Late Republic and the beginning of the early Roman Principate. With its 773 mm long blade it can be classified as a long sword.At least this is what an analysis of preserved sword blades of the Roman Principate suggests, according to which the transition between short swords (gladii) and long swords (spathae) is to be estimated at a blade length (without the tang) between 550 and 600 mm.14 To what extent this statement can be transferred to the swords of the Roman Republic is, however, the subject of controversy.15 This is due particularly to a group of blades that was identified by the majority of scholars in the past two decades16 as belonging to the type described in ancient literature as the gladius hispaniensis.17 According to a text, the authorship of which is assigned to Polybius (ca. 200 u2013120 BC),18 the Roman army adopted the gladius hispaniensis at the end of the third century BC from Celtiberians and apparently adapted the foreign weapon to their own technical abilities or ideas of forms as they existed already at this date. The written sources describe this kind of sword as relatively short and handy.Unfortunately, there are so far no unequivocal indications from u201cpure u201d Roman contexts that might permit an absolutely certain archaeological identification of this standard weapon of the Roman army in late Republican times.In any case, the body of Republican militaria, for which the use by regular Roman soldiers can certainly be proven, is minimal. Thus, those blades, which are favored by scholars as evidence for the gladius hispaniensis (e.g., Fig. 14.1 u20132, Fig. 15), of which the waisted blade shape after all shows a strong relation to early Roman Imperial short swords of the Mainz type,19 are in their large majority from sites in contact areas between the Roman sphere of influence and the late Iron Age societies of Central and western Europe.20 In these areas, Italo-Roman imported goods were frequent components of representative behavior of higher social classes.21 Nevertheless some of the mentioned societies had independent, highly evolved traditions of sword making. n nKeeping the above in mind, we have to assume a use of potentially Roman imported swords alongside native products that adapted an originally Roman design for locally preferred longer blades.22 The putative identified gladii hispanienses, with their blade lengths ranging between 590/600 and 700 mm, and in individual cases achieving significantly greater lengths, thus also clearly contrast with the Roman infantry u2019s short swords of the Roman Principate, with blade lengths mostly below 550 mm. When it comes to the above mentioned length analysis of predominantly Roman Imperial blades, the supposed gladii hispanienses must thus be classified as long swords (spathae).This apparent contradiction has raised doubts in recent literature about the accuracy of using the length 550/600 mm as the dividing threshold between short and long swords.23 However, a closer examination reveals that there is no such contradiction. The linguistic/academic distinction between gladius, alias short sword, and spatha, alias long sword, common today, essentially relies on a passage of Tacitus (Annales 12.35).In this source of the late first century AD the term spatha, which is used literarily for the first time here to characterize a specific kind of sword, is contrasted with the term gladius, which was well established in literature, without any further explanation. According to Vegetius (Epitome 2.15.4),24 who refers to older written sources, the spatha is merely a gladius maior.This insight allows us to understand the specific text passage in Tacitus as offering a contrast between short and long swords.At the same time, the term gladius maior also means that while the basic word gladius referred to a u201csword u201d, it need not necessarily have specified a short one. It is the adjectives added to the primary word or the literary context that allow for a more precise definition.However, in the case of the gladius hispaniensis, literary sources25 just reveal that the weapon should have been shorter than contemporary Gaulish swords.26 Their blade dimensions, between 700 and 900 mm, frequently range at the upper end of the spectrum of lengths which is ascertainable for Roman Imperial long swords.27 In the early Roman Principate, i.e., in the period in which Tacitus wrote, the longest blade normally even reached the shorter length, or at the most the lower end of the described range.28 It thus appears conceivable that the gladius hispaniensis was not an explicit short sword even by ancient or at least Roman Imperial standards, but instead was a gladius maior (=spatha) with a comparatively short blade.29 At least this would be valid for the majority of the sword finds which currently appear as gladius hispaniensis in recent literature. The above-mentioned contradiction would thus have been solved. n nIn any event, however, the constant association of archaeological finds with special terms from ancient literature is always risky, because it gives a scientific theory based on archaeological finds the appearance of being a statement of facts ascertained through ancient primary written sources.At the same time it forces a group of real objects into a literarily prescribed frame of historical development and use, to which future interpretations of archaeological evidence and finds are adjusted more or less consciously. The price of this framework could be a good degree of critical distance and academic objectivity.That is to say, if an object is described rather vaguely in ancient literature, and the situation of archaeological sources is not absolutely clear, the use of ancient terms should definitely be avoided and a neutral, purely find-material oriented description of types should be preferred.In the case of alleged finds of gladii hispanienses, regardless of the arguments pro and contra the accuracy of their designation,30 we are confronted with, first, the problem of an imprecisely defined or definable maximum length and, second, the problem of their relation to swords of the Roman Principate. n nWith respect to the first point, as indicated above, the group of supposed gladii hispanienses also includes blades that doubtless belong to its form typology, but contrary to literary descriptions, do not fall short of the contemporary u201cGallic u201d spathae in terms of their length. n nWith respect to the second point it should be noted that blades of the group of supposed gladii hipanienses continue to be evidenced until the beginning of the early Principate.31 Then, as early as the Augustan period, their lengths at once stand in a strong contrast with the significantly inferior lengths of those infantry swords, the use of which by the Roman army for the first time is demonstrated by archaeological contexts. Whereas we lack finds that could illuminate possible intermediate steps, and the line of development to these typologically related short swords thus remains obscure, the length and some form elements of the presumed gladii hispanienses continue without a break until the early Roman Imperial long swords.32 n nIn order to prevent typological confusion and a bias with regard to the gladius hispaniensis, I prefer to continue using the same terminology of sword types defined for the beginning of the Principate on a secure material basis, as also in the late Republican period, so long as no conceivable typological changes call for a different categorization. n nPrecisely in this sense, the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos can be classified as a spatha of the Nauportus type.33 This type comprises those long swords with clearly waisted blade (contours) and long points, thus closely related to early Roman Imperial short swords of the Mainz type (variants u201cSisak u201d, u201cM u00fchlbach u201c and u201cClassic u201d).34 While the tang length of the present sword corresponds to the usual value of this blade type, the 773 mm long blade clearly differs from most comparable examples, with the majority of blade lengths between 640 and 700 mm. The width, too, of 58 mm is somewhat above the common dimensions, which range between 40 and 55 mm.The dimensions of at least one of the two Nauportus type swords from Alesia (D u00e9p. C u00f4te d u2019Or, France [Fig. 14.1] with a possible terminus ante quem at 52 BC) are roughly comparable.35 This rapier-like sword blade tapers strongly to its point, though unfortunately only preserved in fragments, and displays a maximum width of 58 mm. Old photos allow its reconstruction to a blade length of about 735 to 760/770 mm (ca. 925 to 955 mm including the tang).The proportions of the weapon from Soknopaiou Nesos, however, find closer parallels in the second blade from Alesia (Fig. 14.2)36 or for example also in swords from graves 71, 119 and 471 of the cemetery at Giubiasco (Canton Ticino, Switzerland),37 even though the blades of the latter are only between 610 and 700 mm long (without the tang) and between 40 and 56 mm wide (Fig. 15.2 u20133). The three last mentioned grave finds already date to the second half of the first century BC and the early Augustan period.38 In any case, a closer examination of comparable pieces with similarly strongly, intentionally waisted blades,39 such as the example from Soknopaiou Nesos, discloses an essential concentration of find contexts in the first century BC and the Augustan period.40 n n3.The components of the scabbard n nTogether with the sword blade from grave 471 at Giubiasco, some traces of its wooden scabbard and large parts of the iron scabbard frame were preserved (Fig. 15.2).41 Along with the respective remains of horizontal strip-like frame clamps and carrying clamps (suspension bands), one of which included the fragment of a hooked-in carrying ring, the frame surely conveys a good impression of what we can presume to be the appearance of the scabbard frame of the spatha from Soknopaiou Nesos. Self-sustaining iron scabbard frames are generally assumed to have been used by the Roman army upon Celtiberian inspiration in context with the establishment of the gladius hispaniensis,42 and recur in Roman contexts until the general abandonment of so-called u201cframe-scabbards u201d around the mid-first century AD.Their evidence again concentrates in the first century BC, whereas the use of copper alloy was important for more recent frame-scabbards. With respect to the frame clamps and carrying clamps (suspension bands), the shift to non-ferrous metal had apparently concluded already in the early Augustan period.This observation is supported by the circumstance that most iron scabbard frames of Roman or Roman-influenced swords from the last third of the first century BC are already combined with bronze/brass clamps43 alongside the first completely non-ferrous metal frames, as for example the Nauportus type spatha from grave 119 at Giubiasco.44 Then again, a (Nauportus type?) spatha in grave 31 (La T u00e8ne D2) in the necropolis of San Bernardo in Ornavasso (Italy) has an iron scabbard frame (Fig. 15.1), probably combined with at least partially iron clamps and simple carrying rings.45 On the other hand, a sword from Delos), revealed beneath the debris of the destruction caused by a pirate attack in 69 BC, was equipped solely with simple iron frame clamps and carrying clamps (suspension bands), holding together a pure leather scabbard with a leather frame (Fig. 14.4).46 For a closer chronological classification of the scabbard frame that belongs to the spatha from Soknopaiou Nesos, its pure iron composition u2013so far as this is reconstructable u2013 as well as the shape of its terminal knob can be taken into account (Fig. 11, 13). The separately produced spherical knob with a horizontal groove all round and the nozzle-shaped neck seem to vaguely anticipate the structuring or fastening traits common, although more elaborate and diverse, to many of the mainly non-ferrous metal terminal knobs of scabbard bindings of the early Roman Principate.47 n nTo sum up, a date for the frame-scabbard from Soknopaiou Nesos to the period between the mid-first century BC and the early Augustan period seems plausible. n n4. The hilt elements n nWithout doubt, the most remarkable elements of the sword presented here are the remaining parts of its hilt, i.e., the pommel and what is left of its grip. n nWhat is unusual about the grip is the fact that it is simply made of cloth wrapped around the tang (Fig. 12.1).Judging from other swords of the Roman Principate, one would most probably have expected a Roman or Roman-influenced sword to have a solid, tube-shaped, wood or bone grip sleeve, slid onto the tang (Fig. 16.1 u20132).48 Among the earliest archaeologically attested Roman grips of this kind are cylindrical to barrel-shaped grip sleeves with their surface decorated with parallel grooves/cannelures running along the axis of the grip or spirally around it (Fig. 16.1). A relatively homogenous group of similarly produced grips, with a certain chronological concentration in the Augustan and Tiberian period, presumably draws on Republican traditions.49 The census-relief of the so-called Ara of Domitius Ahenobarbus in Rome (late second to first half of the first century BC)50 shows Roman soldiers, and a depiction of a sword grip with similar cannelures (Fig. 17), possibly supporting the aforementioned hypothesis. On the other hand, we cannot exclude that the spiral groove of this stone relief may just mean a simple textile or leather band wrapped tightly around the blade tang.Ultimately, it is conceivable that even the similarly arranged groups of grooves on the surface of the solid grip sleeve at the beginning of the Roman Principate represent an abstract decorative adaptation of an originally real wrapped feature. If we accept this last suggestion, the singularity of the remains of the sword grip from Soknopaiou Nesos could simply result from a modern research gap caused by the perishable character of the wrapping material. n nLastly, the classification of the pommel made of ebony is no less problematic (Fig. 11, Fig. 12).The contours of its front side present a shape that is so far mainly familiar from ancient reliefs. Worth mentioning are, for example, the early hilts of Celtic warriors on Etruscan monuments, as for example a stela from the Certosa necropolis in Bologna, ancient Felsina, ([Fig. 18] second half of the fifth century BC);51 or the hilts of captured Galatian arms on the balustrade screens in the Athena sanctuary from Pergamon ([Fig. 19.2 u20132a] around 183 BC),52 and finally representations of swords in the context of late Republican to early Imperial Roman army equipment, as for instance on the epitaph of the centurion Minucius in Padua (Fig. 20, ca. 44 u201342 BC)53 or the relief blocks of a pillar tomb with the scene of an equestrian combat from Arlon (Belgium [Fig. 21] ca. third quarter of the first century AD).54 Both the latter monument, possibly representing Gaulish auxiliary cavalry of the Roman army, and the Pergamene arms reliefs or monuments such as the stela from Bologna, which ought to be considered alongside further Italian representations of barbaric warriors with similar sword hilts,55 could support the hypothesis that such hilts were inspired by Celtic armament. This had similarly structured metal hilt elements, both three-dimensional objects (Fig. 22.2)56 u2013 especially on the so-called u201cKnollenknaufschwerter u201d with knobbly pommels (Fig. 22.3)57 u2013 as well as riveted elements on the front side combined with hilt components made of organic material (Fig. 22.1),58 as is evidenced already for the late Hallstatt/early Lat u00e8ne period.Irrespective of the fact that the so-called gladius hispaniensis is the adaptation of a special blade shape from Celtiberian armament, it seems questionable whether Celtic hilt forms developed such a great impact as to have the centurion Minucius in Padua (Fig. 20) and numerous other Roman officers be depicted on Italian funerary or honorary monuments of the first century BC with similarly designed sword- or dagger-pommels.59 Examples are, among others, the reliefs in Modena (Italy; [Fig. 23] ca. second half of the first century BC),60 in Mentana (Italy; [Fig. 24] 40 u201330 BC),61 in Isernia (Italy; around 27 BC)62 or in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (ca. last quarter of the first century BC).63 It is striking that u2013 apart from the relevant hilts u2013 the other equipment presented on the mentioned monuments, or more precisely, the armament and the clothing (such as linothoraces or muscle cuirasses, pteryges and paludamenta) and u2013 as far as identifiable u2013 also the manner of bearing the sword on the balteus display unequivocal Hellenistic-Italic traditions. Occasionally, this connection is even unquestionable for the hilt of the sword/dagger, as for example on an Augustan epitaph in the Carlsberg Glypothek in Copenhagen.64 As on the above-mentioned relief from Mentana (Fig. 24), the officer is represented with nothing but a draped paludamentum in otherwise heroic nudity.He thus carries on the tradition of the idealized Hellenistic image of the ruler,65 which in this case is further emphasised by the hilt of a Graeco-Italian xiphos. Following on from the strong Hellenistic influences, evident in the aforementioned Roman relief depictions, we are confronted with the question whether spherical structured forms of pommels actually ought to be stressed as an element which emanates from Celtic influence, or whether Hellenistic armament can have had similar pommels.In the absence of significant archaeological finds from Eastern Mediterranean contexts of the third to the first century BC, we cannot give a secure answer to this question. At least the tang of the sword from Delos (terminus ante quem around 69 BC)66 mentioned above (Fig. 14.4), with its preserved mushroom- or ball-headed rivets from the fitting of a previously organic pommel, could represent a suitable clue, if we were to consider that the piece need not necessarily be an imported Roman weapon.67 We can perhaps gather the best impression of the former appearance of this pommel by consulting early Roman Imperial reliefs from the oasis town of Palmyra, which show armed gods in an hybrid Hellenistic-oriental style (e.g., Fig. 26).68 On top of the local costume, these gods wear pteryges, and finally also a muscle cuirass or, alternatively, an oriental lamellar armor resembling Hellenistic linothorax (including fascia and chlamys). According to oriental custom, the sword is mostly fixed to a narrow waist belt but has a frame-scabbard with two carrying clamps (suspension bands), corresponding to early Roman Imperial weapons.In so far as discernible, the hand-guards of these swords often demonstrate a more or less high angular shape, such as those represented already on Greek weapons on the balustrade screens (Fig. 19.2b u2013c) from Pergamon (ca. 183 BC)69 or on eastern Greek epitaph reliefs from the second to first century BC (Fig. 25).70 Most probably, the shape is to be interpreted as a reminiscence of the wide angular scabbard lockets of traditional Graeco-Italic xiph u0113.71 The oriental and Mediterranean details of costume and armor are now joined and complemented by u201cknobbly u201d sword pommels, which are represented en masse on Palmyrene reliefs of gods of the late first century BC to first century AD. According to the proportions of the individual u201cknobs u201d to one another, here, too, we can observe both depictions which u2013 regarding the sword from Delos u2013 could indicate an organic spherical pommel with a fitting of metal mushroom- or ball-headed rivets,72 as well as depictions in which the exterior contours and interior composition of the front side perfectly correspond to the preserved ebony pommel of the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). The most striking examples in this context are provided by the much cited Palmyrene relief plate (ca. first half of the first century AD) with the divine triad Baal-Shamin, Aglibol and Malakbel in the Louvre in Paris since 1945 (Fig. 26).73 Although we cannot exclude the possibility that Celtic south-east migrations during the third century BC74 started a massive Celtic influence on Hellenistic sword equipment, possibly continued by the Galatian colonization in central Anatolia, it has little explanatory force for the concentration of u201cknobbly pommels u201d in divine depictions in a Hellenistic-oriental desert metropolis.75 Unfortunately, the Palmyrene wealth of significant sword depictions from the beginning of the early Roman Principate is unique in the Parthian Empire and its peripheral areas. Even from Ptolemaic to early Roman Egypt, no contemporary illustrations of swords seem to be available, as far as the authors know, which indicates once more that the u201cknobbly pommels u201d could have been usual elements of a late Hellenistic oriental form tradition or merely that they were frequently used in the region in question, respectively the Fayyum or even the closer surroundings of Soknopaiou Nesos.76 Related considerations notwithstanding, a miniature sword/dagger (Fig. 27; SO12/-/3852) of lead (length just above 6 cm) which evokes Celtic-influenced late Iron Age sword hilts (Fig. 15,4),77 was found near the Southern wall of the temenos in Soknopaiou Nesos and was possibly once donated as a votive.78 The bent design of its grip/hand-guard79 could serve as a reminder that the possibility of Celtic/Galatian foreign influences should not be ignored entirely even in the Fayyum.80 n nIrrespective of the above discussion, the choice of ebony as the material for the sword pommel of the weapon from Soknopaiou Nesos (Fig. 11, Fig. 12) does not seem to suggest an import from Europe or Asia Minor. A closer inspection reveals, in addition, that the model and comparable examples for its entire form can ultimately not be established in the La T u00e8ne milieu.This becomes apparent as soon as the pommel is regarded not just from the front, and the barely lat u00e8noide spindle-shaped/cylindrical shape of the lateral u201cknobs u201d can be appreciated more clearly.Viewed from above (Fig. 11.2, 12.2 u20133), the piece has contours rather like the head of a hammer. Surprisingly, an intensive review of Egyptian small finds has directed us to a group of rare objects, which are entirely or partially similar to the presented sword pommel, not just looking from the top, but also from the front.However, these small finds are manufactured of stone or of bone, and, according to Flinders Petrie,81 they are interpreted as pre-dynastic mace-heads.While many of these finds cannot be dated with greater precision, the damaged longitudinal half of a similar u201cknobbed mace-head u201d of green serpentine (Fig. 28), found in 2006 in grave 26 (ca. first half of the fourth millennium BC; Naqada period II) in the pre-dynastic elite necropolis HK6 at Hierakonpolis,82 seems to preliminarily confirm this dating. Three further u201cknobbed mace-heads u201d made of quartz (Fig. 29.1a u2013b; height: 47 mm), calcite (Fig. 29.2a u2013b; width/height: 77 x 70 mm) and of dark green steatite (Fig. 29.3a u2013b; width/height: 69 x 55 mm),83 were acquired on the Egyptian antiquities market in Upper Egypt by the Egyptian collection of University College London.84 They seem to be more of less exact analogies to the sword pommel from Soknopaiou Nesos, but made of stone. At least three further good parallels are stored in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.85 One of them (Fig. 30, 25554) consists of green-black stone (presumably serpentine; width/height/depth: ca. 72 x 55 x 49 mm) and was found in Luxor/Thebai.The other two old finds (45047) are from Mit Rahina/Memphis (1914) and are made of ivory (Fig. 31; width/height/depth: ca. 67 x 56 x 44 u201345 mm) and bone (Fig. 32; perhaps horse bone; width/height/depth: ca. 80 x 75 x 54 u201355 mm). The remains of small iron nails and discoloration from corrosion in the latter example (Fig. 32) show that the cancellous bone protruding from both narrow sides was covered by non-ferrous metal sheets.Unfortunately, there is no further information on the find contexts of the three pieces in the Cairo Egyptian Museum, as was the case for the London collection.The u201cknobbed mace-heads u201d represent a comparatively insignificant number within the spectrum of the shapes of Egyptian mace-heads.86 Their appearance is attributed to Near Eastern influences in the first half of the fourth millennium BC.87 Literature, partly dating back nearly a century,88 has referred to the Near Eastern knobbed mace-heads from Susa, Iraq (Fig. 33; final fifth / early fourth millennium BC)89 and from grave 114 at Tepe Gawra near Khorsabad (Iraq, ca. 4000 u20133800 BC)90 as the ideal examples or predecessors of the Egyptian ones. However, these objects are essentially rather representatives of the large group of u201cpear-shaped mace-heads u201d with mainly smooth surfaces, including three to four semi-spherically protruding round to oval bumps, almost resembling applications.Even though a u201cpear-shaped mace-head u201d made of pink limestone and with three knobs from the Naqada-II-period grave 3740 at Badari91 may support the idea of the influence of these Near Eastern knobbed mace-heads on the Egyptian development of mace-heads, it does not suffice to determine a coherent line of development toward those Egyptian examples with more strongly subdivided forms like those in the sword hilt from Soknopaiou Nesos.92 Nevertheless, because of the mentioned fragments of mace-heads from grave 26 (HK6) from Hierakonpolis (Fig. 28) the appearance of this shape as early as the fourth millennium BC cannot be argued away. n nIn light of the above observations, we must of course face the question of how the existence of a sword pommel of identical design can be explained in an almost four millennia younger weapon. n nAn initially intuitive explanation could be that a mace-head that was already an antiquity in the Ptolemaic/Augustan period, possibly having been dug up from the ground, could have been mounted in secondary usage to a contemporary sword due to its pleasing form or other motivations. However, the numerous depictions of comparable pommels on contemporary Roman and Hellenistic/oriental monuments discussed above necessarily refute this explanation.What is more, a range of locally produced Ptolemaic to early Roman miniature swords/daggers of terracotta are known from Egypt, some of which present comparable pommel shapes to that of the sword of Soknopaiou Nesos, including an attached, horizontally ribbed grip (possibly imitating a wrapped feature?). The finds from an apparently Hellenistic terracotta workshop in the eastern part (site no. 9[5]) of the antique Naukratis near An-Nibayrah93 are just one example (Fig. 34).Bearing this in mind, we must rather question whether the one or the other object is similarly a pommel of Hellenistic to Roman dating, rather than, as interpreted so far, a pre-dynastic u201cknobbed mace-head. u201d Such a function is readily conceivable for the two bone examples from the Cairo Egyptian Museum (Fig. 31, Fig. 32), and it should not be entirely excluded even for stone representatives. This way, we can trace the use of sword elements made of stone (among others, scabbard-slides, hand-guards and pommels), which originate from middle- or east Asian influences, in the North Pontic, South Russian area and in the Near East throughout the entire Roman Imperial period.94 It is noteworthy that some of the presumably pre-dynastic Egyptian u201cknobbed mace-heads u201d contrast to the majority of the other forms of mace-heads by their common feature of a shaft hole, clearly conical to the upper point of emergence, and markedly angular to rectangular at the lower end. The majority have a pierced drill hole, which is straight, only slightly conical or even vaguely hourglass-shaped at the mounting, with a round cross section.This peculiarity could obviously simply be intended to prevent an arbitrary contortion of the u201cknobbed mace-head u201d out of its shaft because of its special, irregular design.Still, we must observe that these angular and conical drilled passages correspond to the ideal design of a tang u2019s passage on early to middle Roman Imperial sword pommels of Roman style. Such considerations notwithstanding, the question remains whether there were circumstances that induced the long survival of an evidently pre-dynastic form of mace-head until its deployment as a pommel for a late Ptolemaic to early Augustan weapon.The importance of the mace as a symbol of power and domination in the Near East and Egypt seems the only conceivable explanation.95 This role lies beind the use of the mace as a consistent component of the attributes of oriental deities.96 Assuming this much, there is finally the question whether the mace-head, the characteristic element of this symbol of power, was shifted from the shaft of a mace to the tang of a sword in the course of an iconographic change in the images of the gods. The accumulation of knobbly pommels or those similar to knobbed mace-heads could, in this term, be easily apprehended in relation with depictions of deities in Palmyra (Fig. 26).This does not necessarily imply that the actual transferral of the mace-head shape, as displayed by the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos (Fig. 11, Fig. 12), was really understood as a personal symbol of power for the respective sword-bearer. The possibly intentional divine reference could rather point to a military symbol of victory and/or assistance or an apotropaic function, as similarly discussed for Roman pendants and knife or sword hilts in the shape of u201cHercules maces u201d (Fig. 16.3).97 On the basis of this interpretation, the cultural reciprocity between Occident and Orient during Alexander u2019s campaigns, or the subsequent empires of Alexander u2019s successors, might have facilitated an adaptation and western diffusion of the u201cknobbed mace-head u201d/knobbly pommel form by means of the Hellenistic sword armament, up to the depiction of u201cknobbly u201d sword hilts on monuments in late Republican Italy. n nIV. Conclusions (Davoli, Ch.Miks) n nThe shape and dimensions of the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos (Fig. 11) suggest a classification as a spatha of the Nauportus type.The design of the scabbard and hilt encourages a dating to the second half of the first century BC or, at the latest, to the Augustan period.According to current state of research, it counts as a Roman or Roman-influenced weapon.Nevertheless, the aforementioned conclusion has to be tempered by the fact that so far the development of Hellenistic swords during the last three centuries BC is quite unclear. Due to the lack of a solid amount of preserved real weapons our knowledge in that matter is mainly dependent on more or less detailed and sometimes quite fanciful iconographical sources in the fine arts.It remains substantially unclear how and when the design of Hellenistic swords possibly picked up certain developments and inspirations from the western Mediterranean area, particularly Spain and Italy, but also Gaul, and to which degree these inspirations were related to Greek traditions and potentially oriental influences.98 In this respect, we must be aware that the partial or full classification of a few swords found in East Mediterranean sites of the Hellenistic period, such as from a grave in Jericho (West Bank; [Fig. 14.3]; ca. first half of the second century BC)99 and from the settlement finds in Delos (Fig. 14.4; terminus ante quem 69 BC),100 as Roman gladii hispanienses is quite precarious.101 Otherwise the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos would now theoretically be the third contextualized u201cforeign find u201d of this kind in the eastern Mediterranean, while an example of the u201cregular u201d late Hellenistic swords, which should be used by the majority in that region during the mentioned time, would be so far completely unknown to scholarship. However, the blade of the weapon from Soknopaiou Nesos has the dimensions of a long sword, and even with the greatest tolerance, we can no longer assume its use by heavy Roman line infantry, i.e., by legionaries.We can consider that in the late Republican Roman army at least infantry or cavalry auxiliary contingents were mainly composed of allied peoples with still strong indigenous elements of costume and armament.102 An accurate analysis of the preserved hilt elements suggests that at least the u201cfinal mounting u201d of the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos presumably took place in an oriental, perhaps even Egyptian workshop. With regard to its postulated dating, it is also imaginable that it was used in the course of arming parts of late Ptolemaic troops.On the basis of this circumstance alone, special explanatory models of the sword u2019s arrival in the Fayyum are redundant.On the other hand, countless possibilities arise u2013 even for a weapon from a Roman armory103 u2013 in the context of Roman-Egyptian relations and conflicts as early as the period between the reinstatement of Ptolemy XII (80 u201351) in 55 BC, possible thanks to a Roman military intervention, and the establishment of Egypt as a Roman province in 30 BC. n nSoknopaiou Nesos itself was, nevertheless, neither a settlement under military influence, nor one displaying evidence for a military installation in its surroundings, which could directly associate the sword with a garrison. The settlement was essentially inhabited by Egyptians,104 and most of the activities represented in papyri are related to the temple, trade, and the breeding of camels.Roman soldiers are mentioned in second and third-century AD papyri with the function of supervising affairs within the kome and of receiving materials for the army by the local priests.105 The last transactions are witnessed by regular receipts.106 A number of petitions from Soknopaiou Nesos (first to third century AD) are addressed to a centurio, but it is unclear where these centurions lived.107 The presence of soldiers in many villages of the Fayyum, both from the Ptolemaic period and the Roman Principate, is well known from papyri and other written sources. In this context, the find of a Hellenistic or Roman sword in Soknopaiou Nesos should not really come as a surprise, regardless of whether members of the army lived in the town or not.In addition, the place of discovery of the weapon, i.e., within the temenos of the main temple, could be significant for the question of the function it served in its last phase.It cannot be stressed enough that the find context was not reliable from an archaeological point of view, as the sword was no longer in its original place of deposition, but instead displaced secondarily, possibly even in recent times. The same can be stressed for the other archaeological contexts where a few other militaria have been found, like an iron and a bronze arrowhead (ST10/706/3346 and ST12/851/3991) of different shapes and dating, as well as the above mentioned miniature lead sword (Fig. 27; SO12/-/3852).108 It is nevertheless not questionable that all these weapons have been found inside the temenos. n nIn short, there are two possible explanations of the final function of the sword. Either it was an u201cactive u201d weapon until its deposition somewhere in the temenos, belonging to the defensive repertoire of the settlement and/or the sanctuary, or it was a votive object dedicated to the temple, maybe exhibited for a certain time, and then stored in an adjoining building (ST 21?) or, perhaps, ritually buried.109 n nIn the first case, we have to assume that the sword was discarded as an obsolete weapon, given its date and the long life of the settlement, which was abandoned in the mid-third century AD. Its deposition place was in the surface layer made of sand and debris and thus cannot be considered as a first century BC level. n nIn the second case, the sword must be classified as an individual votive offering rather than as part of a larger offering of war booty, due to the lack of other items of coeval armament.Depending on its original owner, it can thus have had a decisive individual symbolic value110 or have been of supra-regional importance.111 Assuming a certain time of use, it seems plausible that it was dedicated at the latest in the early first century AD. Nonetheless, this does not exclude the possibility of a much earlier date for its dedication and removal from the original exhibition place already during the renovation of the temple at the end of the Ptolemaic/beginning of the Roman period.112 n nAll these considerations are merely speculative until future excavations will possibly yield new finds in more reliable contexts that can illuminate the meaning of the presence of weapons within the temple precinct, as well as the significance of the presence of soldiers in Soknopaiou Nesos. One pointer rotated one turn per year, showing the position of the sun in the zodiac; probably the same pointer4 showed also the day in the calendar ring. A second pointer rotated one turn per sidereal month, showing the position of the moon in the zodiac. n nThe moon pointer included a delightful and prominent detail, partially conserved in the back of Fragment See Figure 1.One half of a small ball was seen in a small circular window. A long and well preserved sword was brought to light in 2006 during the archaeological excavations carried out by the Soknopaiou Nesos Project (University of Salento, Lecce) in the temenos of the main temple in Soknopaiou Nesos, modern Dime.The current state of research would suggest a classification as a Roman, or at least Roman influenced, weapon of the late Republican period.However, some peculiar elements of this sword seem to point to an oriental or Egyptian final assemblage. It thus may give a new impulse to the still open discussion about the appearance of Hellenistic swords starting from the period of Alexander's Successors.The weapon can have been used by soldiers of the late Ptolemaic period as well as by members of the Roman army.The question whether the sword ended up in the temenos as part of local defensive arms or as a votive object will largely remain speculative, as its find context is not stratigraphically reliable.

It is located in a desert area, north of Lake Qarun, and its function was mainly religious and commercial (Fig. 1).Archaeological evidence attests to the presence in this area of settlements, tombs and other features datable from the Neolithic to Islamic periods.The local landscape has undergone several drastic changes during this long period of time, from a wet to a hyper-arid environment.However, there is a strong possibility that one of the reasons for a new foundation or refoundation of a settlement at the beginning of the Hellenistic period was the presence of a revered sanctuary on top of a natural hill. In fact, below the Hellenistic period temple dedicated to the god Soknopaios, features of a previous phase have been found but not yet precisely dated.2#p1At the end of the Ptolemaic period or beginning of the Roman period the temple was renovated and the dromos restored and extended toward the south, probably twice.Also the settlement was enlarged and the houses aggregated in blocks to accommodate an increase of the population. The abandonment of the kome is dated to the mid-third century AD, but the reasons are so far unknown.However, people returned to live in the temenos area between the fourth and the seventh century.#p2The archaeological excavation carried on by the Soknopaiou Nesos Project is mainly concentrated in the temple area, where no previous scientific work was carried out.The sacred area, dedicated to the god Soknopaios, is enclosed by a temenos wall (ca. 88 x 125 m) and is in general quite well preserved across its elements, i.e., the main temple, chapels, houses and service buildings. Despite natural erosion, the spoliation of the limestone blocks and illicit excavations, the temenos area is an interesting context to study and one of the better preserved in the Fayyum (Fig. 2). A considerable number of papyri has been found by treasure hunters in the temple precinct at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth; these are now preserved in several collections. Basalt statues were also found in a good state of preservation, but it is not clear where they were found, whether inside the temenos or on the dromos, the ceremonial road that crosses the settlement from north to south and connected the temple with the edge of the town.3#p3Topographic and geophysical surveys have been carried out in the settlement during the regular excavation seasons; these have allowed a better knowledge of the archaeological site. Two methods have been followed in the geophysical survey,4 magnetometry and electrical resistivity, but they did not produce the expected results because the difference in the magnetic fields of the materials used in the buildings and the sand that covers them is too small.However, it was possible to establish the presence of buildings buried by sand and debris in different areas, and of some highly magnetic zones. These can be interpreted mainly as ovens or fireplaces in domestic buildings, but two strong positive peaks suggested the presence of anomalous materials.One of these is located in Area 1 of the geophysical survey, which is located inside the temenos (Fig. 3, Fig. 4), west of building ST 20 under excavation.The anomaly revealed the presence at a shallow depth (calculated between 50 and 80 cm) of an object about 1 meter long, south of the standing walls of a building (labelled ST 21) built with local stone and mud brick and with the same technique as the Ptolemaic temple ST 18. Our first hypothesis for the interpretation of the magnetic anomaly was the presence of a basalt statue, which would have been a common occurrence in a temple area.It was then decided to open a new sector in building ST 21 to verify this supposition.In fact, the finding of a statue in context would have probably shed new light on those found in the past and of which the place of discovery is still unknown. However, the magnetic anomaly turned out to be something completely unexpected for a temple context: a complete iron sword (ST06/338/1474+2557) (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) Its first appearance was of extreme fragility, and thus we operated with a first consolidation before starting its removal and transfer to the Supreme Council of Antiquities general storehouse at Kom Aushim.Aly Taha Omar, from the Egyptian-Italian Center for Restoration and Archaeology in Cairo, consolidated the sword and the sand below it with sprayed paraloid and prepared a wooden box for its transportation (Fig. 7). In 2008 Mohammed Ahmed, a freelance conservator, removed the paraloid and proceeded with the cleaning and consolidation of the sword.The rusted iron that covered completely the object turned out to be from the scabbard and not from the blade, which is perfectly preserved, along with the final part of the scabbard, where the iron sheet is thicker than in its upper part.Every iron piece has been maintained and consolidated. The ebony pommel did not need any treatment and is still very solid and unchanged.In contrast, the padding of the grip made with a red textile was found in very fragile condition and only partly preserved.It has also been treated in order to preserve it to the maximum extent possible.In 2012 a series of X-ray images was taken in the storehouse by means of an old portable X-ray machine from Medinet el-Fayyum.5 The results, however, are not useful for a detailed study of the manufacture of the object. At present the sword and all its related pieces are stored in a wooden box, with foam supports shaped to fit, in the SCA general storehouse of Kom Aushim (Fayyum); they are registered in the SCA official register as no. 159 The archaeological context (Davoli) .The trench, called Saggio 1, was initially 4 x 3 m; it was then enlarged to 10 x 6 m to cover the area of building ST 21, which was only partially visible at the beginning of the excavation. The area had a slope down toward the east and was covered by sand mixed with mud brick debris in varying concentrations. n nThe excavation was limited to the surface layers that covered the upper part of the subterranean rooms of ST 21.In fact, the building is almost completely destroyed in its ground floor, and only parts of the north walls survive.It is actually composed of two structures built in two different phases: the most ancient one is called ST 21 I, while the most recent is ST 21 II (Fig. 8, Fig. 9, and Fig. 10). The two buildings seem to have been part of one structure, of which only part of the underground rooms and walls survives.In fact, the south wall 339 seems to be part of the second phase (ST 21 II).The technique and building materials are different and not uniformly used: the walls of the underground rooms are built in mud brick, while the perimeter walls are made with a mixed technique, with rough slabs of local brown limestone at the base and mud brick on top. n nSeven underground rooms have been recognized, of which at least five were originally covered with barrel vaults, all oriented north u2013south and made in mud brick. The exploration of these rooms has been postponed till after the end of the excavation of the main temple ST 20, for logistical reasons. n nRoom A (2.0 x 0.90 m) was a cellar, accessible through a shaft located in the southeast corner, and was originally covered by a vault. n nRoom B (2.5 x 0.80 m) was a L-shaped cellar covered by a vault, and with the entrance shaft probably located northwest of it. n nRoom C (2.10 m long) is a cellar with its original vault completely preserved. This is covered with part of the mud-brick floor of the upper room.The entrance vertical shaft is at its north side and is still well preserved (53 x 45 cm). n nRoom D (1.70 x 0.64 m) was also a barrel-vaulted cellar, but its north end is not preserved. n nThe central, irregular space G was probably not a cellar but only a space full of sand in the foundations of the building.The sword and a castanet half were found on top of it. The sword was lying 80 cm north of the stone wall ST06/339 and immediately to the east of the vault of room C (ST06/374). n nRooms E and F are part of the second phase building (ST 21 II). E was a cellar (1.70 x 0.90 m) with a sort of niche on its east wall, while it is not clear if room F (1.48 x 0.92 m) was used as a cellar or if it was a space in the foundations. n nThe stratigraphy covering the building (average thickness 60 cm) is unreliable, and the objects in it are certainly not in their original contexts.6 The surface deposits were made of wind-blown sand and debris (ST06/336),7 and of a concentration of mud bricks (ST06/337). These two units covered a layer of sand with mud brick rubble and organic materials, such as seeds of different fruits (ST06/338) and straw.In the surface layers ST06/336 and 337 a broken pottery statuette (ST06/336/1395),8 three bronze coins, including one of Ptolemy VI (ST06/336/1447) and two drachmae of Antoninus Pius (ST06/336/1455, 1456),9 a fragment of a capital made in plaster (ST06/337/1419), a wooden bolt (ST06/337/1729), a complete lamp (ST06/337/1587),10 and a blue glass bead (ST06/337/1755) have been found. The iron sword, with a knob in ebony (ST06/338/1474) and the terminal part of the scabbard (ST06/338/2557), was found lying horizontally oriented north u2013south, at an elevation of 26 m asl (Figs. 5, Fig. 6).It seems an artificial deposition, at about 50 cm below the surface, but a depositional pit cutting DSU ST06/338 has not been recognized.Other items found in the same DSU are a fragment of a wooden seal (ST06/338/1390), an iron blade of a knife (ST06/338/1462), a bronze needle (ST06/338/1472), an illegible coin (ST06/338/1473), a wooden knob for a box (ST06/338/1479), a wood castanet half (ST06/338/1688),11 and a bead in blue fa u00efence (ST06/338/1751). n nIII. The sword (Ch.Miks)12 n n1.Description of the find n nThe sword (ST06/0338/1474) was found near structure ST 21, which was revealed in Saggio 1 (season 2006).At the time of the deposition, it was still stuck within its scabbard (ST06/0338/2557).Unfortunately, despite the arid climate the preservation of all components of the weapon was not good enough to conserve them permanently in their original position. Even upon restoration a certain reduction of material is to be observed.The following analysis essentially draws upon the blade with the pommel and parts of the grip as well as remains of metal components of the suspension and the lower end of the sword scabbard (Fig. 11). n nWith the exception of a few nicks, the iron blade is fully preserved.It weighs around 1.3 kg (including the pommel and grip). From the point to the remains of the peened over/riveted end of the tang it measures 945 mm, consisting of the 172 mm long tang, 13.7 mm wide at its lower end, and the 773 mm long blade.The latter is characterized by slightly declining shoulders and waisted contours, that is to say, a partially arched indentation in the course of both cutting edges, and an extremely long point.Accordingly, its width changes significantly. It reaches 58 mm at the shoulders, 41.9 mm at the waist and 56.8 mm again at the transition to the point.The cross-section of the blade is of a flattened rhombic shape with a clearly accentuated central ridge.The strength of the blade along this central ridge also varies from 7.8 mm at the start of the tang, which demonstrates a rectangular cross-section, to 5.5 mm at the transition to the point of the blade. A particular local thickening of the point is not found. Its final area is once more accented by a slight kink in the blade u2019s edges.Without a metallographic analysis we cannot attempt any conclusions on the forging technological composition of the blade.Neither an optical nor an X-ray survey, the latter realized in adverse circumstances, yielded structures which might suggest the composition of different iron/steel elements with potentially varying degrees of hardness.13 n nThe single entirely preserved element of the former hilt is a dominant pommel, which remains applied to the end of the tang of the sword (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). According to Davoli, it is made of a piece of ebony.It is 95.7 mm wide, 81.7 mm high and 66 mm deep.Deep indentations divide its body clearly.Basically, the central design element is a ball, which sits on a central base protruding to its front and rear.At the same time, each side has an u201cinserted u201d, or annexed, cylindrical or spindle-shaped element.The pommel is vertically drilled through with a conical drill hole that allows it to be slid onto the tang. On its bottom side, the shape of the drill hole is adjusted to the rectangular cross-section of the sword u2019s tang, which is still around 8.5 mm wide at the point of entrance (Fig. 12.3).At the point at which it exits on the top of the pommel, the end of the tang is peened over to a mushroom-shaped mere approximately 6.5 mm wide and about 3 mm high, through which all of the hilt parts of the sword would formerly have been fixed to the tang to prevent them from slipping (Fig. 12.2). The fact that the rivet head lacks an additional metal plate to ensure a sufficient pressure of the riveting denotes the density and hardness of the wood of which the pommel was made. n nParts of the grip immediately below the pommel had originally been preserved (Fig. 12.1).They did not consist of firm hilt plates or of a grip sleeve but of a red textile, which was wrapped tightly around the tang as a thick bundle. When the sword was found, it remained on three of the four tang sides with an approximate length of 61.5 mm.In contrast to the length, the width discernible at the time of about 29 mm and the depth/width (including the tang) of a maximum of ca. 27 mm, will have been quite close to the original dimensions of the grip. n nThe well preserved sword blade and pommel stand in stark contrast to the scanty remains of the scabbard (ST06/0338/2557). The best-preserved fragment is a 215 mm long piece of a metal binding of the lower end of the scabbard (Fig. 11, 13).This constitutes the parts of two channel-shaped edge bindings made of a 2 mm thick iron sheet.In the area of the former point of the scabbard they are merged within the nozzle-shaped neck of a separately manufactured spherical terminal knob (diameter 20 mm) with a horizontal groove all around. The internal width of the binding u2019s channel is 14.5 mm at the most and conveys a vague idea of the thickness of the former organic scabbard body at its lower end.The organic parts of the scabbard have disappeared, and therefore it is not possible to determine what material it was made of.Given the dimensions of the binding u2019s channel, however, the scabbard could very well have been supported by a thinner wooden body. Numerous metal fragments, which the restoration process separated from the blade, could indicate that the edge binding once continued above the area of the scabbard u2019s point, and thus that once a complete scabbard frame may have existed (Fig. 11.1).Among these there are four 22 mm wide strip-like fragments of 2 mm thick iron sheet, possibly originating from horizontal frame- or carrying-clamps (suspension bands). The remains of four simple iron rings (diameter 19 mm) further indicate the former existence of a corresponding suspension of the scabbard.They are made of 3.5 mm strong rod material with circular cross-section. n n2.The blade n nThe waisted blade of the sword with its long extended point doubtless places the present weapon alongside comparably shaped Roman or at least Roman-influenced swords from find contexts of the Late Republic and the beginning of the early Roman Principate. With its 773 mm long blade it can be classified as a long sword.At least this is what an analysis of preserved sword blades of the Roman Principate suggests, according to which the transition between short swords (gladii) and long swords (spathae) is to be estimated at a blade length (without the tang) between 550 and 600 mm.14 To what extent this statement can be transferred to the swords of the Roman Republic is, however, the subject of controversy.15 This is due particularly to a group of blades that was identified by the majority of scholars in the past two decades16 as belonging to the type described in ancient literature as the gladius hispaniensis.17 According to a text, the authorship of which is assigned to Polybius (ca. 200 u2013120 BC),18 the Roman army adopted the gladius hispaniensis at the end of the third century BC from Celtiberians and apparently adapted the foreign weapon to their own technical abilities or ideas of forms as they existed already at this date. The written sources describe this kind of sword as relatively short and handy.Unfortunately, there are so far no unequivocal indications from u201cpure u201d Roman contexts that might permit an absolutely certain archaeological identification of this standard weapon of the Roman army in late Republican times.In any case, the body of Republican militaria, for which the use by regular Roman soldiers can certainly be proven, is minimal. Thus, those blades, which are favored by scholars as evidence for the gladius hispaniensis (e.g., Fig. 14.1 u20132, Fig. 15), of which the waisted blade shape after all shows a strong relation to early Roman Imperial short swords of the Mainz type,19 are in their large majority from sites in contact areas between the Roman sphere of influence and the late Iron Age societies of Central and western Europe.20 In these areas, Italo-Roman imported goods were frequent components of representative behavior of higher social classes.21 Nevertheless some of the mentioned societies had independent, highly evolved traditions of sword making. n nKeeping the above in mind, we have to assume a use of potentially Roman imported swords alongside native products that adapted an originally Roman design for locally preferred longer blades.22 The putative identified gladii hispanienses, with their blade lengths ranging between 590/600 and 700 mm, and in individual cases achieving significantly greater lengths, thus also clearly contrast with the Roman infantry u2019s short swords of the Roman Principate, with blade lengths mostly below 550 mm. When it comes to the above mentioned length analysis of predominantly Roman Imperial blades, the supposed gladii hispanienses must thus be classified as long swords (spathae).This apparent contradiction has raised doubts in recent literature about the accuracy of using the length 550/600 mm as the dividing threshold between short and long swords.23 However, a closer examination reveals that there is no such contradiction. The linguistic/academic distinction between gladius, alias short sword, and spatha, alias long sword, common today, essentially relies on a passage of Tacitus (Annales 12.35).In this source of the late first century AD the term spatha, which is used literarily for the first time here to characterize a specific kind of sword, is contrasted with the term gladius, which was well established in literature, without any further explanation. According to Vegetius (Epitome 2.15.4),24 who refers to older written sources, the spatha is merely a gladius maior.This insight allows us to understand the specific text passage in Tacitus as offering a contrast between short and long swords.At the same time, the term gladius maior also means that while the basic word gladius referred to a u201csword u201d, it need not necessarily have specified a short one. It is the adjectives added to the primary word or the literary context that allow for a more precise definition.However, in the case of the gladius hispaniensis, literary sources25 just reveal that the weapon should have been shorter than contemporary Gaulish swords.26 Their blade dimensions, between 700 and 900 mm, frequently range at the upper end of the spectrum of lengths which is ascertainable for Roman Imperial long swords.27 In the early Roman Principate, i.e., in the period in which Tacitus wrote, the longest blade normally even reached the shorter length, or at the most the lower end of the described range.28 It thus appears conceivable that the gladius hispaniensis was not an explicit short sword even by ancient or at least Roman Imperial standards, but instead was a gladius maior (=spatha) with a comparatively short blade.29 At least this would be valid for the majority of the sword finds which currently appear as gladius hispaniensis in recent literature. The above-mentioned contradiction would thus have been solved. n nIn any event, however, the constant association of archaeological finds with special terms from ancient literature is always risky, because it gives a scientific theory based on archaeological finds the appearance of being a statement of facts ascertained through ancient primary written sources.At the same time it forces a group of real objects into a literarily prescribed frame of historical development and use, to which future interpretations of archaeological evidence and finds are adjusted more or less consciously. The price of this framework could be a good degree of critical distance and academic objectivity.That is to say, if an object is described rather vaguely in ancient literature, and the situation of archaeological sources is not absolutely clear, the use of ancient terms should definitely be avoided and a neutral, purely find-material oriented description of types should be preferred.In the case of alleged finds of gladii hispanienses, regardless of the arguments pro and contra the accuracy of their designation,30 we are confronted with, first, the problem of an imprecisely defined or definable maximum length and, second, the problem of their relation to swords of the Roman Principate. n nWith respect to the first point, as indicated above, the group of supposed gladii hispanienses also includes blades that doubtless belong to its form typology, but contrary to literary descriptions, do not fall short of the contemporary u201cGallic u201d spathae in terms of their length. n nWith respect to the second point it should be noted that blades of the group of supposed gladii hipanienses continue to be evidenced until the beginning of the early Principate.31 Then, as early as the Augustan period, their lengths at once stand in a strong contrast with the significantly inferior lengths of those infantry swords, the use of which by the Roman army for the first time is demonstrated by archaeological contexts. Whereas we lack finds that could illuminate possible intermediate steps, and the line of development to these typologically related short swords thus remains obscure, the length and some form elements of the presumed gladii hispanienses continue without a break until the early Roman Imperial long swords.32 n nIn order to prevent typological confusion and a bias with regard to the gladius hispaniensis, I prefer to continue using the same terminology of sword types defined for the beginning of the Principate on a secure material basis, as also in the late Republican period, so long as no conceivable typological changes call for a different categorization. n nPrecisely in this sense, the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos can be classified as a spatha of the Nauportus type.33 This type comprises those long swords with clearly waisted blade (contours) and long points, thus closely related to early Roman Imperial short swords of the Mainz type (variants u201cSisak u201d, u201cM u00fchlbach u201c and u201cClassic u201d).34 While the tang length of the present sword corresponds to the usual value of this blade type, the 773 mm long blade clearly differs from most comparable examples, with the majority of blade lengths between 640 and 700 mm. The width, too, of 58 mm is somewhat above the common dimensions, which range between 40 and 55 mm.The dimensions of at least one of the two Nauportus type swords from Alesia (D u00e9p. C u00f4te d u2019Or, France [Fig. 14.1] with a possible terminus ante quem at 52 BC) are roughly comparable.35 This rapier-like sword blade tapers strongly to its point, though unfortunately only preserved in fragments, and displays a maximum width of 58 mm. Old photos allow its reconstruction to a blade length of about 735 to 760/770 mm (ca. 925 to 955 mm including the tang).The proportions of the weapon from Soknopaiou Nesos, however, find closer parallels in the second blade from Alesia (Fig. 14.2)36 or for example also in swords from graves 71, 119 and 471 of the cemetery at Giubiasco (Canton Ticino, Switzerland),37 even though the blades of the latter are only between 610 and 700 mm long (without the tang) and between 40 and 56 mm wide (Fig. 15.2 u20133). The three last mentioned grave finds already date to the second half of the first century BC and the early Augustan period.38 In any case, a closer examination of comparable pieces with similarly strongly, intentionally waisted blades,39 such as the example from Soknopaiou Nesos, discloses an essential concentration of find contexts in the first century BC and the Augustan period.40 n n3.The components of the scabbard n nTogether with the sword blade from grave 471 at Giubiasco, some traces of its wooden scabbard and large parts of the iron scabbard frame were preserved (Fig. 15.2).41 Along with the respective remains of horizontal strip-like frame clamps and carrying clamps (suspension bands), one of which included the fragment of a hooked-in carrying ring, the frame surely conveys a good impression of what we can presume to be the appearance of the scabbard frame of the spatha from Soknopaiou Nesos. Self-sustaining iron scabbard frames are generally assumed to have been used by the Roman army upon Celtiberian inspiration in context with the establishment of the gladius hispaniensis,42 and recur in Roman contexts until the general abandonment of so-called u201cframe-scabbards u201d around the mid-first century AD.Their evidence again concentrates in the first century BC, whereas the use of copper alloy was important for more recent frame-scabbards. With respect to the frame clamps and carrying clamps (suspension bands), the shift to non-ferrous metal had apparently concluded already in the early Augustan period.This observation is supported by the circumstance that most iron scabbard frames of Roman or Roman-influenced swords from the last third of the first century BC are already combined with bronze/brass clamps43 alongside the first completely non-ferrous metal frames, as for example the Nauportus type spatha from grave 119 at Giubiasco.44 Then again, a (Nauportus type?) spatha in grave 31 (La T u00e8ne D2) in the necropolis of San Bernardo in Ornavasso (Italy) has an iron scabbard frame (Fig. 15.1), probably combined with at least partially iron clamps and simple carrying rings.45 On the other hand, a sword from Delos), revealed beneath the debris of the destruction caused by a pirate attack in 69 BC, was equipped solely with simple iron frame clamps and carrying clamps (suspension bands), holding together a pure leather scabbard with a leather frame (Fig. 14.4).46 For a closer chronological classification of the scabbard frame that belongs to the spatha from Soknopaiou Nesos, its pure iron composition u2013so far as this is reconstructable u2013 as well as the shape of its terminal knob can be taken into account (Fig. 11, 13). The separately produced spherical knob with a horizontal groove all round and the nozzle-shaped neck seem to vaguely anticipate the structuring or fastening traits common, although more elaborate and diverse, to many of the mainly non-ferrous metal terminal knobs of scabbard bindings of the early Roman Principate.47 n nTo sum up, a date for the frame-scabbard from Soknopaiou Nesos to the period between the mid-first century BC and the early Augustan period seems plausible. n n4. The hilt elements n nWithout doubt, the most remarkable elements of the sword presented here are the remaining parts of its hilt, i.e., the pommel and what is left of its grip. n nWhat is unusual about the grip is the fact that it is simply made of cloth wrapped around the tang (Fig. 12.1).Judging from other swords of the Roman Principate, one would most probably have expected a Roman or Roman-influenced sword to have a solid, tube-shaped, wood or bone grip sleeve, slid onto the tang (Fig. 16.1 u20132).48 Among the earliest archaeologically attested Roman grips of this kind are cylindrical to barrel-shaped grip sleeves with their surface decorated with parallel grooves/cannelures running along the axis of the grip or spirally around it (Fig. 16.1). A relatively homogenous group of similarly produced grips, with a certain chronological concentration in the Augustan and Tiberian period, presumably draws on Republican traditions.49 The census-relief of the so-called Ara of Domitius Ahenobarbus in Rome (late second to first half of the first century BC)50 shows Roman soldiers, and a depiction of a sword grip with similar cannelures (Fig. 17), possibly supporting the aforementioned hypothesis. On the other hand, we cannot exclude that the spiral groove of this stone relief may just mean a simple textile or leather band wrapped tightly around the blade tang.Ultimately, it is conceivable that even the similarly arranged groups of grooves on the surface of the solid grip sleeve at the beginning of the Roman Principate represent an abstract decorative adaptation of an originally real wrapped feature. If we accept this last suggestion, the singularity of the remains of the sword grip from Soknopaiou Nesos could simply result from a modern research gap caused by the perishable character of the wrapping material. n nLastly, the classification of the pommel made of ebony is no less problematic (Fig. 11, Fig. 12).The contours of its front side present a shape that is so far mainly familiar from ancient reliefs. Worth mentioning are, for example, the early hilts of Celtic warriors on Etruscan monuments, as for example a stela from the Certosa necropolis in Bologna, ancient Felsina, ([Fig. 18] second half of the fifth century BC);51 or the hilts of captured Galatian arms on the balustrade screens in the Athena sanctuary from Pergamon ([Fig. 19.2 u20132a] around 183 BC),52 and finally representations of swords in the context of late Republican to early Imperial Roman army equipment, as for instance on the epitaph of the centurion Minucius in Padua (Fig. 20, ca. 44 u201342 BC)53 or the relief blocks of a pillar tomb with the scene of an equestrian combat from Arlon (Belgium [Fig. 21] ca. third quarter of the first century AD).54 Both the latter monument, possibly representing Gaulish auxiliary cavalry of the Roman army, and the Pergamene arms reliefs or monuments such as the stela from Bologna, which ought to be considered alongside further Italian representations of barbaric warriors with similar sword hilts,55 could support the hypothesis that such hilts were inspired by Celtic armament. This had similarly structured metal hilt elements, both three-dimensional objects (Fig. 22.2)56 u2013 especially on the so-called u201cKnollenknaufschwerter u201d with knobbly pommels (Fig. 22.3)57 u2013 as well as riveted elements on the front side combined with hilt components made of organic material (Fig. 22.1),58 as is evidenced already for the late Hallstatt/early Lat u00e8ne period.Irrespective of the fact that the so-called gladius hispaniensis is the adaptation of a special blade shape from Celtiberian armament, it seems questionable whether Celtic hilt forms developed such a great impact as to have the centurion Minucius in Padua (Fig. 20) and numerous other Roman officers be depicted on Italian funerary or honorary monuments of the first century BC with similarly designed sword- or dagger-pommels.59 Examples are, among others, the reliefs in Modena (Italy; [Fig. 23] ca. second half of the first century BC),60 in Mentana (Italy; [Fig. 24] 40 u201330 BC),61 in Isernia (Italy; around 27 BC)62 or in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (ca. last quarter of the first century BC).63 It is striking that u2013 apart from the relevant hilts u2013 the other equipment presented on the mentioned monuments, or more precisely, the armament and the clothing (such as linothoraces or muscle cuirasses, pteryges and paludamenta) and u2013 as far as identifiable u2013 also the manner of bearing the sword on the balteus display unequivocal Hellenistic-Italic traditions. Occasionally, this connection is even unquestionable for the hilt of the sword/dagger, as for example on an Augustan epitaph in the Carlsberg Glypothek in Copenhagen.64 As on the above-mentioned relief from Mentana (Fig. 24), the officer is represented with nothing but a draped paludamentum in otherwise heroic nudity.He thus carries on the tradition of the idealized Hellenistic image of the ruler,65 which in this case is further emphasised by the hilt of a Graeco-Italian xiphos. Following on from the strong Hellenistic influences, evident in the aforementioned Roman relief depictions, we are confronted with the question whether spherical structured forms of pommels actually ought to be stressed as an element which emanates from Celtic influence, or whether Hellenistic armament can have had similar pommels.In the absence of significant archaeological finds from Eastern Mediterranean contexts of the third to the first century BC, we cannot give a secure answer to this question. At least the tang of the sword from Delos (terminus ante quem around 69 BC)66 mentioned above (Fig. 14.4), with its preserved mushroom- or ball-headed rivets from the fitting of a previously organic pommel, could represent a suitable clue, if we were to consider that the piece need not necessarily be an imported Roman weapon.67 We can perhaps gather the best impression of the former appearance of this pommel by consulting early Roman Imperial reliefs from the oasis town of Palmyra, which show armed gods in an hybrid Hellenistic-oriental style (e.g., Fig. 26).68 On top of the local costume, these gods wear pteryges, and finally also a muscle cuirass or, alternatively, an oriental lamellar armor resembling Hellenistic linothorax (including fascia and chlamys). According to oriental custom, the sword is mostly fixed to a narrow waist belt but has a frame-scabbard with two carrying clamps (suspension bands), corresponding to early Roman Imperial weapons.In so far as discernible, the hand-guards of these swords often demonstrate a more or less high angular shape, such as those represented already on Greek weapons on the balustrade screens (Fig. 19.2b u2013c) from Pergamon (ca. 183 BC)69 or on eastern Greek epitaph reliefs from the second to first century BC (Fig. 25).70 Most probably, the shape is to be interpreted as a reminiscence of the wide angular scabbard lockets of traditional Graeco-Italic xiph u0113.71 The oriental and Mediterranean details of costume and armor are now joined and complemented by u201cknobbly u201d sword pommels, which are represented en masse on Palmyrene reliefs of gods of the late first century BC to first century AD. According to the proportions of the individual u201cknobs u201d to one another, here, too, we can observe both depictions which u2013 regarding the sword from Delos u2013 could indicate an organic spherical pommel with a fitting of metal mushroom- or ball-headed rivets,72 as well as depictions in which the exterior contours and interior composition of the front side perfectly correspond to the preserved ebony pommel of the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). The most striking examples in this context are provided by the much cited Palmyrene relief plate (ca. first half of the first century AD) with the divine triad Baal-Shamin, Aglibol and Malakbel in the Louvre in Paris since 1945 (Fig. 26).73 Although we cannot exclude the possibility that Celtic south-east migrations during the third century BC74 started a massive Celtic influence on Hellenistic sword equipment, possibly continued by the Galatian colonization in central Anatolia, it has little explanatory force for the concentration of u201cknobbly pommels u201d in divine depictions in a Hellenistic-oriental desert metropolis.75 Unfortunately, the Palmyrene wealth of significant sword depictions from the beginning of the early Roman Principate is unique in the Parthian Empire and its peripheral areas. Even from Ptolemaic to early Roman Egypt, no contemporary illustrations of swords seem to be available, as far as the authors know, which indicates once more that the u201cknobbly pommels u201d could have been usual elements of a late Hellenistic oriental form tradition or merely that they were frequently used in the region in question, respectively the Fayyum or even the closer surroundings of Soknopaiou Nesos.76 Related considerations notwithstanding, a miniature sword/dagger (Fig. 27; SO12/-/3852) of lead (length just above 6 cm) which evokes Celtic-influenced late Iron Age sword hilts (Fig. 15,4),77 was found near the Southern wall of the temenos in Soknopaiou Nesos and was possibly once donated as a votive.78 The bent design of its grip/hand-guard79 could serve as a reminder that the possibility of Celtic/Galatian foreign influences should not be ignored entirely even in the Fayyum.80 n nIrrespective of the above discussion, the choice of ebony as the material for the sword pommel of the weapon from Soknopaiou Nesos (Fig. 11, Fig. 12) does not seem to suggest an import from Europe or Asia Minor. A closer inspection reveals, in addition, that the model and comparable examples for its entire form can ultimately not be established in the La T u00e8ne milieu.This becomes apparent as soon as the pommel is regarded not just from the front, and the barely lat u00e8noide spindle-shaped/cylindrical shape of the lateral u201cknobs u201d can be appreciated more clearly.Viewed from above (Fig. 11.2, 12.2 u20133), the piece has contours rather like the head of a hammer. Surprisingly, an intensive review of Egyptian small finds has directed us to a group of rare objects, which are entirely or partially similar to the presented sword pommel, not just looking from the top, but also from the front.However, these small finds are manufactured of stone or of bone, and, according to Flinders Petrie,81 they are interpreted as pre-dynastic mace-heads.While many of these finds cannot be dated with greater precision, the damaged longitudinal half of a similar u201cknobbed mace-head u201d of green serpentine (Fig. 28), found in 2006 in grave 26 (ca. first half of the fourth millennium BC; Naqada period II) in the pre-dynastic elite necropolis HK6 at Hierakonpolis,82 seems to preliminarily confirm this dating. Three further u201cknobbed mace-heads u201d made of quartz (Fig. 29.1a u2013b; height: 47 mm), calcite (Fig. 29.2a u2013b; width/height: 77 x 70 mm) and of dark green steatite (Fig. 29.3a u2013b; width/height: 69 x 55 mm),83 were acquired on the Egyptian antiquities market in Upper Egypt by the Egyptian collection of University College London.84 They seem to be more of less exact analogies to the sword pommel from Soknopaiou Nesos, but made of stone. At least three further good parallels are stored in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.85 One of them (Fig. 30, 25554) consists of green-black stone (presumably serpentine; width/height/depth: ca. 72 x 55 x 49 mm) and was found in Luxor/Thebai.The other two old finds (45047) are from Mit Rahina/Memphis (1914) and are made of ivory (Fig. 31; width/height/depth: ca. 67 x 56 x 44 u201345 mm) and bone (Fig. 32; perhaps horse bone; width/height/depth: ca. 80 x 75 x 54 u201355 mm). The remains of small iron nails and discoloration from corrosion in the latter example (Fig. 32) show that the cancellous bone protruding from both narrow sides was covered by non-ferrous metal sheets.Unfortunately, there is no further information on the find contexts of the three pieces in the Cairo Egyptian Museum, as was the case for the London collection.The u201cknobbed mace-heads u201d represent a comparatively insignificant number within the spectrum of the shapes of Egyptian mace-heads.86 Their appearance is attributed to Near Eastern influences in the first half of the fourth millennium BC.87 Literature, partly dating back nearly a century,88 has referred to the Near Eastern knobbed mace-heads from Susa, Iraq (Fig. 33; final fifth / early fourth millennium BC)89 and from grave 114 at Tepe Gawra near Khorsabad (Iraq, ca. 4000 u20133800 BC)90 as the ideal examples or predecessors of the Egyptian ones. However, these objects are essentially rather representatives of the large group of u201cpear-shaped mace-heads u201d with mainly smooth surfaces, including three to four semi-spherically protruding round to oval bumps, almost resembling applications.Even though a u201cpear-shaped mace-head u201d made of pink limestone and with three knobs from the Naqada-II-period grave 3740 at Badari91 may support the idea of the influence of these Near Eastern knobbed mace-heads on the Egyptian development of mace-heads, it does not suffice to determine a coherent line of development toward those Egyptian examples with more strongly subdivided forms like those in the sword hilt from Soknopaiou Nesos.92 Nevertheless, because of the mentioned fragments of mace-heads from grave 26 (HK6) from Hierakonpolis (Fig. 28) the appearance of this shape as early as the fourth millennium BC cannot be argued away. n nIn light of the above observations, we must of course face the question of how the existence of a sword pommel of identical design can be explained in an almost four millennia younger weapon. n nAn initially intuitive explanation could be that a mace-head that was already an antiquity in the Ptolemaic/Augustan period, possibly having been dug up from the ground, could have been mounted in secondary usage to a contemporary sword due to its pleasing form or other motivations. However, the numerous depictions of comparable pommels on contemporary Roman and Hellenistic/oriental monuments discussed above necessarily refute this explanation.What is more, a range of locally produced Ptolemaic to early Roman miniature swords/daggers of terracotta are known from Egypt, some of which present comparable pommel shapes to that of the sword of Soknopaiou Nesos, including an attached, horizontally ribbed grip (possibly imitating a wrapped feature?). The finds from an apparently Hellenistic terracotta workshop in the eastern part (site no. 9[5]) of the antique Naukratis near An-Nibayrah93 are just one example (Fig. 34).Bearing this in mind, we must rather question whether the one or the other object is similarly a pommel of Hellenistic to Roman dating, rather than, as interpreted so far, a pre-dynastic u201cknobbed mace-head. u201d Such a function is readily conceivable for the two bone examples from the Cairo Egyptian Museum (Fig. 31, Fig. 32), and it should not be entirely excluded even for stone representatives. This way, we can trace the use of sword elements made of stone (among others, scabbard-slides, hand-guards and pommels), which originate from middle- or east Asian influences, in the North Pontic, South Russian area and in the Near East throughout the entire Roman Imperial period.94 It is noteworthy that some of the presumably pre-dynastic Egyptian u201cknobbed mace-heads u201d contrast to the majority of the other forms of mace-heads by their common feature of a shaft hole, clearly conical to the upper point of emergence, and markedly angular to rectangular at the lower end. The majority have a pierced drill hole, which is straight, only slightly conical or even vaguely hourglass-shaped at the mounting, with a round cross section.This peculiarity could obviously simply be intended to prevent an arbitrary contortion of the u201cknobbed mace-head u201d out of its shaft because of its special, irregular design.Still, we must observe that these angular and conical drilled passages correspond to the ideal design of a tang u2019s passage on early to middle Roman Imperial sword pommels of Roman style. Such considerations notwithstanding, the question remains whether there were circumstances that induced the long survival of an evidently pre-dynastic form of mace-head until its deployment as a pommel for a late Ptolemaic to early Augustan weapon.The importance of the mace as a symbol of power and domination in the Near East and Egypt seems the only conceivable explanation.95 This role lies beind the use of the mace as a consistent component of the attributes of oriental deities.96 Assuming this much, there is finally the question whether the mace-head, the characteristic element of this symbol of power, was shifted from the shaft of a mace to the tang of a sword in the course of an iconographic change in the images of the gods. The accumulation of knobbly pommels or those similar to knobbed mace-heads could, in this term, be easily apprehended in relation with depictions of deities in Palmyra (Fig. 26).This does not necessarily imply that the actual transferral of the mace-head shape, as displayed by the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos (Fig. 11, Fig. 12), was really understood as a personal symbol of power for the respective sword-bearer. The possibly intentional divine reference could rather point to a military symbol of victory and/or assistance or an apotropaic function, as similarly discussed for Roman pendants and knife or sword hilts in the shape of u201cHercules maces u201d (Fig. 16.3).97 On the basis of this interpretation, the cultural reciprocity between Occident and Orient during Alexander u2019s campaigns, or the subsequent empires of Alexander u2019s successors, might have facilitated an adaptation and western diffusion of the u201cknobbed mace-head u201d/knobbly pommel form by means of the Hellenistic sword armament, up to the depiction of u201cknobbly u201d sword hilts on monuments in late Republican Italy. n nIV. Conclusions (Davoli, Ch.Miks) n nThe shape and dimensions of the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos (Fig. 11) suggest a classification as a spatha of the Nauportus type.The design of the scabbard and hilt encourages a dating to the second half of the first century BC or, at the latest, to the Augustan period.According to current state of research, it counts as a Roman or Roman-influenced weapon.Nevertheless, the aforementioned conclusion has to be tempered by the fact that so far the development of Hellenistic swords during the last three centuries BC is quite unclear. Due to the lack of a solid amount of preserved real weapons our knowledge in that matter is mainly dependent on more or less detailed and sometimes quite fanciful iconographical sources in the fine arts.It remains substantially unclear how and when the design of Hellenistic swords possibly picked up certain developments and inspirations from the western Mediterranean area, particularly Spain and Italy, but also Gaul, and to which degree these inspirations were related to Greek traditions and potentially oriental influences.98 In this respect, we must be aware that the partial or full classification of a few swords found in East Mediterranean sites of the Hellenistic period, such as from a grave in Jericho (West Bank; [Fig. 14.3]; ca. first half of the second century BC)99 and from the settlement finds in Delos (Fig. 14.4; terminus ante quem 69 BC),100 as Roman gladii hispanienses is quite precarious.101 Otherwise the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos would now theoretically be the third contextualized u201cforeign find u201d of this kind in the eastern Mediterranean, while an example of the u201cregular u201d late Hellenistic swords, which should be used by the majority in that region during the mentioned time, would be so far completely unknown to scholarship. However, the blade of the weapon from Soknopaiou Nesos has the dimensions of a long sword, and even with the greatest tolerance, we can no longer assume its use by heavy Roman line infantry, i.e., by legionaries.We can consider that in the late Republican Roman army at least infantry or cavalry auxiliary contingents were mainly composed of allied peoples with still strong indigenous elements of costume and armament.102 An accurate analysis of the preserved hilt elements suggests that at least the u201cfinal mounting u201d of the sword from Soknopaiou Nesos presumably took place in an oriental, perhaps even Egyptian workshop. With regard to its postulated dating, it is also imaginable that it was used in the course of arming parts of late Ptolemaic troops.On the basis of this circumstance alone, special explanatory models of the sword u2019s arrival in the Fayyum are redundant.On the other hand, countless possibilities arise u2013 even for a weapon from a Roman armory103 u2013 in the context of Roman-Egyptian relations and conflicts as early as the period between the reinstatement of Ptolemy XII (80 u201351) in 55 BC, possible thanks to a Roman military intervention, and the establishment of Egypt as a Roman province in 30 BC. n nSoknopaiou Nesos itself was, nevertheless, neither a settlement under military influence, nor one displaying evidence for a military installation in its surroundings, which could directly associate the sword with a garrison. The settlement was essentially inhabited by Egyptians,104 and most of the activities represented in papyri are related to the temple, trade, and the breeding of camels.Roman soldiers are mentioned in second and third-century AD papyri with the function of supervising affairs within the kome and of receiving materials for the army by the local priests.105 The last transactions are witnessed by regular receipts.106 A number of petitions from Soknopaiou Nesos (first to third century AD) are addressed to a centurio, but it is unclear where these centurions lived.107 The presence of soldiers in many villages of the Fayyum, both from the Ptolemaic period and the Roman Principate, is well known from papyri and other written sources. In this context, the find of a Hellenistic or Roman sword in Soknopaiou Nesos should not really come as a surprise, regardless of whether members of the army lived in the town or not.In addition, the place of discovery of the weapon, i.e., within the temenos of the main temple, could be significant for the question of the function it served in its last phase.It cannot be stressed enough that the find context was not reliable from an archaeological point of view, as the sword was no longer in its original place of deposition, but instead displaced secondarily, possibly even in recent times. The same can be stressed for the other archaeological contexts where a few other militaria have been found, like an iron and a bronze arrowhead (ST10/706/3346 and ST12/851/3991) of different shapes and dating, as well as the above mentioned miniature lead sword (Fig. 27; SO12/-/3852).108 It is nevertheless not questionable that all these weapons have been found inside the temenos. n nIn short, there are two possible explanations of the final function of the sword. Either it was an u201cactive u201d weapon until its deposition somewhere in the temenos, belonging to the defensive repertoire of the settlement and/or the sanctuary, or it was a votive object dedicated to the temple, maybe exhibited for a certain time, and then stored in an adjoining building (ST 21?) or, perhaps, ritually buried.109 n nIn the first case, we have to assume that the sword was discarded as an obsolete weapon, given its date and the long life of the settlement, which was abandoned in the mid-third century AD. Its deposition place was in the surface layer made of sand and debris and thus cannot be considered as a first century BC level. n nIn the second case, the sword must be classified as an individual votive offering rather than as part of a larger offering of war booty, due to the lack of other items of coeval armament.Depending on its original owner, it can thus have had a decisive individual symbolic value110 or have been of supra-regional importance.111 Assuming a certain time of use, it seems plausible that it was dedicated at the latest in the early first century AD. Nonetheless, this does not exclude the possibility of a much earlier date for its dedication and removal from the original exhibition place already during the renovation of the temple at the end of the Ptolemaic/beginning of the Roman period.112 n nAll these considerations are merely speculative until future excavations will possibly yield new finds in more reliable contexts that can illuminate the meaning of the presence of weapons within the temple precinct, as well as the significance of the presence of soldiers in Soknopaiou Nesos. }, { title : Heath, Rife, Bravo III, and Blasdel. (2015). Preliminary Report on Early Byzantine Pottery from a Building Complex at Kenchreai (Greece). ISAW Papers 10. , content : This paper presents the results of preliminary study of Early Byzantine pottery from a large building near the waterfront at Kenchreai in southern Greece.Kenchreai served as the eastern port of Corinth throughout antiquity.The building was first excavated in 1976 by the Greek Archaeological Service, and it has been investigated since 2014 by the American Excavations at Kenchreai with permission from the Ministry of Culture under the auspices of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. The pottery is characterized by the presence of many Late Roman Amphora 2 rims as well as stoppers and funnels.This indicates that the building had a role in the distribution of regional agricultural products during its final phase, which is dated to the very late sixth or early seventh centures by African Red-Slip and Phocaean Red-Slip tablewares. A wide range of lamps, glass vessels, and other small finds has also been recorded. Results to date are preliminary but ongoing work may allow further precision as to the chronology and use of this building. n nLibrary of Congress Subjects: Kenchreai (Greece); Pottery, Roman; Pottery, Byzantine; Economic history--Medieval, 500-1500. n nContents n nIntroduction n nThe Site of Kenchreai n nTowards a Chronology of the Threpsiades Complex n nPreliminary Quantification of Amphoras n nLarge and Small Late Roman Amphora 2 n nLRA2 Stoppers and Two Funnel Types n nActivities Within the Building n nOther Amphoras n nThe Threpsiades Site and Regional Change n nAcknowledgements n nReferences n nNotes n nIntroduction n nIn 1976 the Greek Archaeological Service under the direction of Kalliopi Kristalli-Votsi, then Ephor of the former 4th u0395 u03a0 u039a u0391 of the Argolidocorinthia, and her assistant, Elisavet Chatzipouliou, excavated a large building at Kenchreai, the town that served as the Aegean port of the major city of Corinth. The building is located very close to the ancient harbor, alongside the National Highway to Epidavros (figs. 1 and 2).Attention was drawn to the site following plans for construction by the landowners at the time, whose surname Threpsiades now serves as the name of the excavated area.The Threpsiades property is a declared archaeological site under the oversight of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture, and the finds recovered in 1976 are stored in the Isthmia Museum.1 n nAs is usual for excavation in a Mediterranean urban environment, pottery makes up the overwhelming bulk of the assemblage. This material is remarkable for a large number of regional and imported amphoras, the latter in much smaller amounts, along with numerous stoppers for the regional vessels and a small group of funnels.The pottery is the main focus of this preliminary report.There is, however, also a rich variety of small finds, including a large group of Late Roman to Early Byzantine glass, including cylinder-blown window panes, trail-decorated flasks with funnel- to U-shaped mouths of a type common in the Byzantine to Islamic Middle East, and possible evidence for glassmaking. These diverse and copious finds suggest that the building complex on the Threpsiades property played a role in the movement of regional agricultural products, and perhaps of consumer goods as well, during the very late sixth to early seventh centuries 2 They provide important new evidence for local vitality, long-distance exchange, and dynamic communication in the northeastern Peloponnese during the Early Byzantine period. n nA summary of the work in 1976 by the Archaeological Service work was published in 1984.3 That report noted the presence of many amphoras and provided basic observations about the building and a massive destruction event involving burning and structural collapse. To date, however, no full study has appeared.In 2013 Ms.Kristalli-Votsi transferred her rights to the site and its finds to Joseph Rife, Director of the American Excavations at Kenchreai.All work at the site and on the finds takes place with the permission of Ministry of Culture and the oversight of the Corinthian Ephoreia under the auspices of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens.In May 2014, Sebastian Heath and Phyllis Graham, with the assistance of Gavin Blasdel, began study of the material in the Isthmia Museum. Rife and Jorge Bravo III, Co-Director of the American Excavations at Kenchreai, began comprehensive re-evaluation of the building on the Threpsiades property in June 2014.The results of these new investigations offer a firmer basis for determining the date of activity in the complex than was previously published.4 Moreover, preliminary quantification of amphora rims provides evidence for assessing the role of Early Byzantine Kenchreai in the regional and Eastern Mediterranean economy. The numbers appearing below are drawn from processing of 93 crates of pottery that hold well over 50,000 sherds.Quantification was done in 2014 and study continued in 2015.While this ongoing work is the beginning of a multi-year process that will lead to full publication, we believe that a timely announcement of our research may be useful to readers and that any responses will benefit us as we move toward more complete results. n nThe Site of Kenchreai n nThe port town of Kenchreai lies at the western end of the Saronic Gulf at the point where the shore is easily reached from Corinth, which lies some 10 km inland and to which Kenchreai was connected by road during the Roman era. The long, irregular ridge of Mount Oneion extends inland just south of the site, and the coast immediately to the north has low cliffs that would have made landing and loading or unloading trade-vessels difficult.Between these coastal stretches, the small, curved bay and beachline today provide access to the water, and movement inland is relatively easy.It is this landward topographic aspect that contributed to the placement of Corinth u2019s eastern harbor, a role that Kenchreai may have served throughout antiquity. While Hellenistic and earlier remains at the site are not well preserved, excavations begun in 1963 under the general direction of Robert Scranton of the University of Chicago for the American School revealed the extensive remains of the Roman port.5 Two massive breakwaters erected probably under Augustus facilitated the reception of maritime traffic and sustained seaborne commerce for centuries.The moles defined clear northern and southern limits of the port and turned an exposed landing into a deep, protected harbor with good anchorage and a long quay. n nThe literary testimony for Kenchreai during the Early to Middle Roman periods attests to local prosperity, social, cultural and religious diversity, and a bustling economy. Strabo (Geographies 8.6.22) wrote of Kenchreai that the Corinthians, u201cuse [it] for trade from Asia. u201d Ovid (Tristia 1.10.9) reported that he boarded the vessel Minerva there and then disembarked at Tempyra on the Thracian coast before proceeding on foot to his exile in Tomis.Kenchreai is briefly mentioned in the New Testament, first as an early stopping point in Paul u2019s journey from Corinth to Syria via Ephesus (Acts 18:18) and then as the home of the deaconess Phoebe (Romans 16:1), whom Paul commends to the Roman church. In his brief description of the port-town, the second-century travel writer Pausanias (Description of Greece 2.2.3) mentions sanctuaries and a bronze statue of Poseidon at the harbor.6 Kenchreai is also the setting for the last book of Apuleius u2019 Metamorphoses (Book 11), in which the protagonist Lucius is initiated into the local cult of Isis.These passages illustrate Kenchreai as a well-connected port and a prosperous community during the first and second centuries n nIt was the report of Pausanias and the visible presence of ancient architecture that motivated the start of excavation in 1963. The initial publication of the site aimed to assimilate the extant architectural remains to the temples of Aphrodite and Isis cited by Pausanias, but subsequent scholarship has called these identifications into question, and they are not now widely held.7 The early phase of the American Excavations in the 1960s also uncovered extensive architectural and artifactual evidence for the Roman port u2019s commercial life. More recent fieldwork has focused on the necropolis and residential quarter on the ridge northeast of the harbor.8 n nUrban development continued at Kenchreai during and beyond the third century.The local community witnessed substantial renovation and expansion of the portside structures during the fourth century.In the late fourth century, one or more seismic disasters led to the abandonment and filling of a fountain court on the south mole. This space was temporarily being used for the storage of crates with over 120 glass panels in opus sectile depicting harbors, Nilotic scenes, and cultural celebrities.9 The difficulties indicated by the loss of these panels, however, were not the end of Roman Kenchreai. A church was built on the south mole around the late fifth or early sixth century, and another early church is located roughly 1 km up the coast in the port u2019s northern suburbs. These structures did not stay in use for very long and seem to have fallen into disrepair by the late sixth or early seventh centuries, perhaps around the time of the unknown destruction event at the Threpsiades complex under consideration in this article.The immediate circumstances of Early Byzantine Kenchreai u2019s further decline in the seventh to ninth centuries are unclear, as are the circumstances that lead to a renewal of activity in the Middle Byzantine period. Today the toponym Kechries ( u039a u03b5 u03c7 u03c1 u03b9 u03ad u03c2) refers to a small village lacking any municipal identity or business and consisting largely of weekend and summer homes. n nTowards a Chronology of the Threpsiades Complex n nThe Threspiades property is located ca. 35 meters due west of the mid-southwest part of the modern public beach, which represents roughly the shoreline of the Roman harbor. It is situated at the northwest corner of the intersection of the highway to Epidavros (Ethniki Odos 10) and the road through the village of Kechries (Odos Apostolou Pavlou).10 Although constrained by existing property lines and modern roads, the excavators in 1976 uncovered multiple large rooms flanking wide halls and an ornate peristyle, all enclosed in a trapezoidal arrangement.The building had a second story indicated by a well-built staircase. This spacious plan and its interior decor suggest that the complex was not built solely as a work-space; perhaps its original use was as a lavish private residence or a monumental public building.In any case, it is clear that the building had developed mainly into a work-space in its final phase before abandonment and its gradual burial under colluvial sediment. n nAt the current stage of study, the date of the earliest phase of the building remains uncertain, though either Middle or Late Roman seems most likely. Moreover, while it is clear that the fabric and use of the building were disrupted by a catastrophic destruction, stratigraphic study of the Threpsiades complex has not yet revealed when this destruction happened.Two scenarios seem most likely.In the first, destruction struck the site at some point in the sixth century and damaged the impressive private or public complex, after which point it was reoccupied for more utilitarian or industrial use that ended in the seventh century. In the second, destruction struck the site at some point in the early seventh century and brought an end to the utilitarian or industrial final use of a formerly impressive private or public complex.It is also possible that the area suffered multiple episodes of destruction. n nAlthough a full and precise chronology of the Threpsiades complex remains elusive, current investigation allows the final phase of activity in the building to be assigned confidently to the very late sixth to early seventh centuries. This date is mainly based on red-slipped tablewares. A nearly complete African Red-Slip (ARS) Hayes form 105 (Fig. 3) with no interior stamped decoration gives a strong terminus post quem of 580.11 Another large fragment of a Hayes 105-type base along with similar, less-well preserved base sherds strengthen this chronology, as do small ARS Hayes form 99c rim sherds.In addition, three well-preserved ARS Hayes II lamps with late discus designs are not inconsistent with the ARS table vessels. We have also recorded a Phocaean Red-Slip (PRS) Hayes form 3f of the sixth century, five PRS Hayes form 10c rims (PRS) and nine Hayes form 10a rims (examples illustrated in Fig. 3).12 While the imported tableware assemblage only supports limited precision on the order of decades the ARS does suggest that the deposit closed by the early seventh century.The material from multiple deposits at Corinth published under the rubric u201cAssemblage 4 u201d within a sequence of Late Roman material is relevant here. ARS forms 107 and 109 are present at Corinth but not identified in the Threpsiades assemblage, which can suggest a closing at Kenchreai before 600.13 Among more recently published early seventh-century assemblages, the material from the so-called u201cBishop u2019s House u201d at Nicopolis is a useful parallel, particularly because ARS Hayes form 105 also contributes to establishing its date, as does a coin of the emperor Phocas (602-610).14 Moreover, discussion of the absence from Nicopolis of ARS Hayes form 109, which as noted also does not occur in the Threpsiades complex, further suggests that overly precise dating from ceramic forms is problematic in the face of competing chronologies and uncertain stratigraphy.15 n nCare is warranted in establishing the chronological limits of the total assemblage from the building and in assessing how much of it was associated with the final phase of activity. Some but not all of the original recording system for the stored artifacts is recoverable.There has been mixing of material between plastic storage crates u2014this has proven that the bottoms of such containers break if overloaded u2014and not all tags were readable at first inspection.Furthermore, we stress that the data appearing in this article were collected during an initial survey of the material. Almost all sherds remain unwashed, so that full processing of the assemblage will reveal more detail.Future clearing of spoilage at the site will undoubtedly contribute more evidence to the finds already stored at Isthmia.Finally, it may be possible to assess more exactly the stratigraphic associations of the finds, in which case our understanding of the depositional sequence and the building u2019s chronology may shift. n nDespite these concerns, we can now characterize certain basic features of the assemblage. It displays a striking degree of consistency.As will be discussed below, the regionally produced Late Roman Amphora 2 (LRA2) predominates.Except for a small number of Hellenistic and perhaps earlier sherds and a small number of Early and Middle Roman sherds, we agree with the original excavator that much of this material is associated with the final phase of occupation.Thus, as this important group of pottery is studied and further cited, it should be kept in mind that it may include a small but uncertain number of sherds that predate Late Antiquity. These would affect the accuracy of any quantification of sherds dated to the late sixth and early seventh centuries. n nPreliminary Quantification of Amphoras n nLate Roman transport amphoras form the most abundant component of the ceramic record in the Threpsiades complex.Preliminary quantification (fig. 4) of 501 rims from the well-known series of Late Roman Amphoras 1 through 5/6 provides a firm basis for situating Kenchreai in both regional and Eastern Mediterranean economic networks.16 It is the case, however, that essentially all the quantification undertaken at this stage of study has been by rim counts. In his review of quantification methods, Pe u00f1a described such data as u201cnot statistically valid. u201d17 While recognizing the shortcomings of this approach, we do believe that the overall impression offered by Figure 4 and Table 1 is useful in discussing the relative amounts of these amphoras present in the complex during Late Antiquity.Moreover, the first two seasons of work have identified amphora forms other than these most widely recognized ones, which will be briefly discussed below. n nType Count Percent Origin LRA2 361 72.1 Aegean LRA1 51 10.2 Cilicia/Cyprus LRA5 46 9.2 Palestine LRA4 39 7.8 Palestine/Gaza LRA3 4 0.8 SW Anatolia n nLarge and Small Late Roman Amphora 2 n nThe round-bodied, high-necked form Late Roman Amphora 2 makes up approximately 72% of the rim count at the Threpsiades site.18 Slane and Sanders have appropriately warned against simplistic usage of this term and we intend it here in a very generic sense.19 As they note, multiple Aegean regions produced this form, a point reinforced by Reynolds u2019 analysis of assemblages at Beirut and Butrint as well as by other studies.20 In the context of this article it is important that the Argolid, which is linked to Kenchreai over the mountainous passes of the southeastern Corinthia, is recognized as a major producer of LRA2 vessels. A kiln-site producing the form near Porto Cheli in the southern Argolid is dated by the presence of ARS, PRS and a coin of the emperor Phocas (602-610).21 That region u2019s workshops produced vessels with an identifiable pinkish fabric and a beige surface.22 The fabric of many of the LRA2 rims, other diagnostics, and body sherds from the Threpsiades excavations is likely of or closely related to this Argolid variety, which has also been identified at Corinth. A further indication that Kenchreai is within one of the multiple active regions of LRA2 production and use comes from the Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey (EKAS), whose members recognized that combed body sherds were among the most abundant Late Roman artifact categories.23 When one considers LRA2 broadly, the recent publication of kilns at Dilesi in Boeotia adds to the increasing firm evidence that production was widespread.24 n nThere is diversity among the LRA2 vessels from the Threpsiades complex. Among those rims measured, we have noted a range of maximum exterior diameters of 9-12 cm.Very large vessels have rim heights just over 5 cm and neck heights just over 9 cm.Rim heights of less massively constructed LRA2 vessels are just under 4 cm but the neck height remains around 9 cm.The rims on the largest vessels are often slightly offset from the neck.We have not refit body sherds, but we note the predominance of deep wavy combing. It is of interest that some LRA2 body sherds bear black characters or symbols.These markings are distinct from the red dipinti that are not uncommon on LRA2 vessels.These preliminary observations suggest directions for future study.In sum, the Threpsiades group of LRA2 amphoras is large enough to encompass differences, but those differences fall within a range that is well-known for the form.25 n nIn addition to the many typical LRA2 amphora rims, we counted 222 rim sherds of distinctly smaller vessels. Figure 5 shows a comparison of the rim and neck profiles of the full-sized or u201clarge u201d and u201csmall u201d types.The smaller version has a less substantial rim that is of more even thickness, and there is often a distinct exterior demarcation as neck turns to rim.The distinction is subtle, presumably because the smaller version was very closely inspired by the larger, but familiarity makes the differences discernible, even between small rim and handle sherds. Further study may show that the u201cLRA2 Small u201d form is best considered a fractional container, meaning that it was produced at a regular and measured proportion of its larger mate.26 n nBeyond Kenchreai, smaller variants of LRA2 are known from Argos, Corinth and Pyrgouthi, among other sites.27 An approximate parallel for the small Threpsiades vessels appears in the late-sixth-century u201cAssemblage 3 u201d at Corinth, which consists mostly of material from an underground chamber near the Baths of Aphrodite; the rim of that vessel appears thicker than ours in the published profile.28 There is an unpublished parallel at Athens, which is illustrated in an excavation notebook that the Agora Excavations makes available online.29 The Sikyon Survey Project has also published an LRA2 rim of small dimension. Other published profiles of smaller LRA2 vessels do not appear to be very close matches.30 A category of u201cLRA2-related u201d so-called amphorette known from Dichin, Bulgaria is very different.31 This brief survey may be enough to suggest that the Kenchreai u201cLRA2 Small u201d vessels and related forms are an LRA2 companion whose distribution far outside the Corinthia and nearby regions may be limited. At Kenchreai the form presumably had a role in surplus-oriented economic activities.At this early stage of study, however, we stress that the exact use of these small containers is unclear, and indeed they may have had multiple uses. }, { title : Carman and Di Cocco. (2016).The moon phase anomaly in the Antikythera Mechanism. ISAW Papers 11. , content : The Antikythera Mechanism is a mechanical astronomical instrument that was discovered in an ancient shipwreck at the beginning of the twentieth century, made about the second century It had several pointers showing the positions of the moon and sun in the zodiac, the approximate date according to a lunisolar calendar, several subsidiary dials showing calendrical phenomena, and also predictions of eclipses. The mechanism also had a display of the Moon u2019s phases: a small ball, half pale and half dark, rotating with the lunar synodic period and so showing the phases of the moon.The remains of the moon phase display include a fragmentary contrate gear.According to the reconstruction offered by Michael Wright, this gear is now pointing unintentionally in the wrong direction.In this paper we offer for the first time a detailed description of the remains of the moon phase mechanism. Based on this evidence, we argue that the extant contrate gear direction is the originally intended one, and we offer a conjectural explanation for its direction as an essential part of a representation of Aristarchus u2019s hypothesis that half moon phase is observably displaced from exact quadrature. n nLibrary of Congress Subjects: Antikythera mechanism (Ancient calculator); Astronomy, Greek. n nContents n nIntroduction n nSection 1: the moon phase mechanism n nSection 2: the direction of the contrate gear n nSection 3: non-uniform motion of the moon phase ball n nAcknowledgements n nReferences n nNotes n nIntroduction n nThe Antikythera Mechanism is a mechanical astronomical instrument that was discovered in an ancient shipwreck at the beginning of the twentieth century. The shipwreck has been dated around 60 1 A consensus does not exist on the question whether the Mechanism was built around that time or significantly earlier.2 After twenty centuries under water, it is incomplete, and broken into several fragments.The extant fragments are nevertheless enough for reconstructing the main structure and functions of the mechanism: it had several pointers, interconnected and worked by toothed gearing, showing the positions of the moon and sun (and probably also the planets) in the zodiac, the approximate date according to a lunisolar calendar, several subsidiary dials showing calendrical phenomena, and also predictions of eclipses.3 n nThe longitudes of the sun and moon were shown on a single dial with two concentric rings: the inner one was divided into the twelve zodiac signs of 30 degrees each, and the outer one into 12 months of 30 days each plus five epagomenal days that constitute a year according to the Egyptian calendar. One pointer rotated one turn per year, showing the position of the sun in the zodiac; probably the same pointer4 showed also the day in the calendar ring. A second pointer rotated one turn per sidereal month, showing the position of the moon in the zodiac. n nThe moon pointer included a delightful and prominent detail, partially conserved in the back of Fragment See Figure 1.One half of a small ball was seen in a small circular window. The ball was half pale and half dark, and it rotated with the lunar synodic period and so showed the phases of the moon.The device was mounted on a small cap, rotating with the lunar sidereal period, to which the (lost) moon pointer was probably attached.See Figure 2.The moon ball was connected to a contrate gear through an arbor.This contrate was driven, either directly or indirectly, by a gear rotating with the solar period. Consequently the ensemble functioned as a differential gear, so that the contrate u2013and with it the little ball u2013 rotated at a rate that was the difference between those of the sun and the moon pointers.Its period of rotation was therefore the synodic period, representing the elongation of the moon from the sun. n nNot having understood the detail of this assembly, Derek de Solla Price (1974: 20) suggested two possible functions for it: 1) it could be u201csome part of the dial work for the center of the front dial, possibly a plate indicating the position of the Moon u201d or 2) u201ca crank handle ... that drives the contrate wheel A u201d. (This refers not to the contrate in Fragment C, of which Price was unaware, but another contrate in Fragment ) Price's first proposal was close to the truth, but he related the device only the moon's position, not with the moon's phases. In any case, Price only mentioned these possibilities, without developing them any further. n nMichael Wright presented a reconstruction of the component as the boss of the pointer for the Moon u2019s position, incorporating a display of the Moon u2019s phase,5 and since then scholars have universally accepted this reconstruction.It could not have been otherwise, because Wright's proposal makes perfect sense and it fits very well with the physical evidence of the extant cap: even to the naked eye, it is easy to see not only the circular window, but also a smooth hemispherical depression behind the circular hole that strongly suggests that the hole was once filled by the small lunar ball. The arbor connecting the place of the ball with the contrate gear is also there, and even around half of the contrate.There is further evidence confirming Wright's proposal, for in the portion of the Back Cover Inscription preserved on Fragment B of the Mechanism a small golden sphere probably refers to the sun, while in a more broken context that was probably describing the lunar display another small sphere is mentioned with which the word u201cblack u201d is most likely associated.6 n nHowever, the contrate is found with its teeth pointing away from the centre of the cap, not towards it as Wright u2019s reconstruction requires (see Figure 3). Wright suggests that this component, as found, had been inserted the wrong way round: u201cIt seems therefore that the Antikythera Mechanism suffered the indignity, depressingly common in the author u2019s experience as curator of a collection of mechanism, of having been taken apart and reassembled incorrectly u201d (Wright 2006: 327). n nTony Freeth has proposed an alternative solution according to which the gear, as found, is correctly placed.7 Two more gears are added, connecting the contrate gear (with its teeth pointing away from the axis) to a gear fixed on the solar axis (see Figure 4). Gear u is fixed to the solar axis and therefore rotates with the solar period.Gear u moves x which has the same number of teeth, so that it rotates at the same rate but in the opposite direction.Gear y, which is fixed to x, rotating at the same rate, has the same number of teeth as the contrate (z) with which it is engaged.This device produces exactly the same result as Wright u2019s proposal, while allowing the teeth of the contrate to be in the extant direction. n nFreeth's proposal is the simplest solution to the problem if, as we will show, there are compelling reasons to consider that the incorrect reassembly proposal should be discarded. But an obvious question still remains: why would the Antikythera Mechanism's maker prefer this more complicated solution to the simpler one proposed by Wright?We know from many other features of the mechanism that the builder was very smart, and reasonably minimalist, even using in several instances parts of the same gear train for different purposes.Therefore, there must be a reason for using four instead of two gears. n nIn this paper, we will offer for the first time a detailed description of the remains of the moon ball mechanism as it can be seen in the CT data, trying to make sense of every feature (section 1). This examination will incidentally show the surprising intricacy of the tiny components of this apparatus, some of which must have been custom designed for this application.Then we will consider, in the light of this analysis, whether it is possible that the extant contrate gear direction is not the originally intended one, and we will show that the proposal of incorrect reassembly should be discarded (section 2). Finally we will offer a conjectural explanation for a modified version of Freeth u2019s configuration (section 3). n nSection 1: the moon phase mechanism n nIn this section we offer a detailed description of the remains of the mechanism and, based on it, a plausible reconstruction of the mechanism that made the moon ball rotate. n nDescription of evidence n nWe have used photographs, PTMs, and CT to examine the physical remains. Measurements were made using the ruler tool included in 3D Slicer 4.4.0 software on the CT.We give our measurements to the nearest tenth of a millimeter.We estimate that most of our measurements are probably accurate to a few tenths of a millimeter.8 In a mechanism such as the moon phase device with its small pieces it would be desirable to have a greater degree of accuracy but, as Freeth and Jones (2012: ) noted, u201cthe features u2026 in the fragments are invariably heavily corroded, they are often affected by heavy calcification and they are sometimes broken u201d. In order to specify the directions of the pieces of the device, we will always determine them as viewed from the Mechanism's inside , i.e., as we actually see them in photos of Fragment C (face C-2), schemes and drawings (see, for example, Figure 1. n nThe moon phase device is mounted on a circular plate (plate thickness: 1.4 mm) with a radius of about 33.8 mm.The plate is colored red in the diagram of Figure 5; see also Figure 6. The plate has a rim in its border 7.1 mm high and with the same width as the plate so that the radius of the plate inside the rim is about 32.5 mm.The rim is not complete and has suffered obvious damage, especially in the zone close to the moon ball.The missing rim extends from around 23 u00b0 counterclockwise of the arbor to 73.4 u00b0 clockwise.Notwithstanding this gap, it seems probable that the rim was originally complete in the zone near where the moon ball was, since the missing moon pointer was probably aligned with the arbor, and so should have been attached in some way to the rim in this place. (There are no traces of features to hold the pointer at a level close to the moon plate.) n nIn the inner part of the plate is the footprint of what seems to have been another rim that intentionally formed an incomplete circular arc. This rim was not concentric with the plate.Its center is in the line of the axis of the arbor, but 4.2 mm from the center of the moon cap in the direction of the moon ball.The footprint has an inner radius of 14.2 mm and an outer radius of 16.4 mm.The arc is open where it would otherwise pass through the arbor window (described below).The opening of the arc is 41.5 u00b0 on each side of the arbor's axis. See Figure 7.Similar rims are preserved attached (apparently by solder) to the base plate in Fragment A, where they served to stabilize large gears in planes parallel to the base plate.Following Wright (Wright 2006: 328-329) we refer to them as curbs (or, in Wright's English spelling, kerbs). n nIn the center of the plate is a squared hole of side around 3 mm (the side closer to the plane of the arbor is 2.9 mm long, while the side perpendicular to that one is 3.2 mm long.) The arbor that turned the moon cap and with it the moon pointer passed through this hole. The hole is not aligned with the arbor of the moon ball; relative to the arbor its sides are rotated 19.5 u00b0 counterclockwise. (We do not see any particular significance in this non-alignment.) See Figure 8, reference n nClose to the squared hole and beyond it with respect to the contrate gear, there is a clear Tau inscribed on the inner surface of the plate.It is roughly aligned with the arbor axis but slightly rotated counterclockwise with respect to the plane of the arbor axis, but not as much as the squared hole. Its base is 2.7 mm distant from the border of the hole.It is 2.3 mm high and 2.5 mm wide.The purpose of this inscription is not certain, but was probably a symbol for identifying where the part belonged for purposes of assembly (Price 1974: 20 and Freeth and Jones 2012: ).See Figure 8, reference n nThe cap plate is traversed by another large window with a complex shape.See Figure 8, references 1, 2, 3 and 4. The window's long dimension runs along part of a radius of the plate, starting a couple of millimeters from the squared window and extending right to the rim.The window's shape is symmetrical with respect to this radius.For convenience of description we will treat the window as comprising four distinct sections.From the center to the border, these are as follows: 1) The first section is the smallest; it is just one millimeter long and 2.7 mm wide. It was presumably intended to accommodate the tip of the arbor that extended beyond the contrate gear (see Figure 8, reference 1).The wall of the window that is nearest to the plate's center is not perpendicular to the plane of the cap plate but tilts such that, while the hole is 1 mm long at the inner surface of the plate, it is 1.4 mm long at the outer surface (see Figure 9). 2) The second section was intended to house the contrate gear. It is 5.7 mm long and 11.5 mm wide (see Figure 8, reference 2). 3) The third section housed the arbor; it is 14.9 mm long and 3.3 mm wide (see Figure 8, reference 3). 4) The final section is the circular moon ball window, with a diameter of about 8.1 mm.The border of this part of the window is damaged, especially to the left of the arbor (see Figure 8, reference 4). n nThe arbor (blue in the diagram of Figure 5) is 22.4 mm long and 1.7 mm wide. It is broken into two pieces (Figure 10, reference 1).The smaller is around 6.4 mm long and is closer to the center of the moon cap; the larger is 16 mm long.In the smaller piece, the arbor has a rectangular cross-section.After the break, the arbor is cylindrical.The smaller part holds the contrate gear; just a small part of the arbor towards the center of the cap plate projects about 0.8 mm beyond the contrate gear (Figure 10, reference 4). This tip is located in the first section of the arbor window. 1.3 mm from this end, the arbor is perforated crossways by a pinhole of 0.8 mm diameter (Figure 10, reference 2).The hole is exactly aligned with a rectangular slot on the back face of the contrate gear (Figure 10, reference 3).The pin that the hole and slot were meant to accommodate is missing.The arbor has just enough space along its length to accommodate the contrate between the pinhole and a squared collar of sides 3.7 mm and 2.5 mm length along the axis of the arbor. This collar might have been a separate component attached in somehow to the arbor, but since close study of the CT does not show any traces of a boundary between the arbor and the collar, we believe that the collar is probably one piece with the arbor (see Figure 11).The break in the arbor comes right after the collar.Inside the collar the CT shows a small radiodense globule, almost spherical, with a diameter of roughly 1 mm, whose significance is not clear to us if it is not simply a bit of free metal that was protected from corrosion by the thickness of the collar (Figure 10, reference 6). After the break, as previously noted, the arbor is cylindrical, and is enclosed in a kind of pipe (the arbor keeper) that will be described later.The arbor, as it is preserved, continues a bit beyond the pipe and into the moon ball window, for less than a millimeter.In the arbor's interior, close to the break, is another radiodense globule with an elliptical shape (major axis 1.38 mm, minor axis 0.9 mm, Figure 10, reference 7). n nThe contrate (blue in the diagram of Figure 5) is also broken. The extant part is almost exactly half of the complete gear and is located above the plate, i.e., in the face of the plate opposite to that of the rim.The gear has an outer diameter of 11.2 mm, an inner diameter of 7 mm, and a width of 5.2 mm (see Figure 12).As already mentioned, the back face of the gear (opposite to that of the teeth) is crossed diametrically by a rectangular slot 1.3 mm wide and 0.8 mm high, which is aligned with the pinhole of the arbor, and thus would have allowed the gear to be fixed to the arbor by means of a pin (Figure 10, reference 3). Ten teeth of the gear have survived.The distance from tooth valley to tooth valley is approximately 1.7 mm, which is consistent with a complete tooth count of 20.The high of the teeth is also on average 1.7 mm. n nAttached to the inner part of the cap plate and along each side of the third section of the big window, i.e. the arbor window, are two pieces of metal (green in the diagram of Figure 5), mirror-images of each other, that extend almost the whole length of the arbor window (leaving just 0.5 mm of the window free, at the end closer to the contrate). See Figure 13.Each of these pieces has a complex shape in which it is possible to distinguish two parts: 1) closer to the contrate is a long rectangle that we will call, following Wright u2019s terminology, a u201ccheek u201d (Wright 2006: 326) (Figure 13, reference 1), and 2) adjoined to it (and probably making just one metal piece with the cheek) a cube with a pinhole that we will call the u201cholder u201d (Figure 13, reference 2). The cheeks are 10 mm long, 3.2 mm wide, and 1.2 mm high.They are 2.1 mm apart, so they partially cover the arbor window, which is 3.3 mm wide.Each cheek has a small, clearly intentional indent like a very shallow groove running along the side that is partially closing the window.This depression is 0.6 mm wide and just 0.4 mm deep.The depression is as wide as the part of the cheek that overhangs the window. The initial impression obtained from CT or photographs is that the depression is present along just the first 4.1 mm of the cheek closest to the contrate gear; however, closer inspection of the CT shows that the depression u2013with the same width and depth u2013 continues all the way to the holders, but is covered along the part towards the moon window by a thin tab of metal that belongs to the arbor keeper pipe u2014to be described later u2014and not to the cheeks (see Figure 14). At the extremity of each cheek closer to the moon ball is located the second part of this component, the holder.The cheeks suddenly increase in height in a vertical wall, reaching 2.9 mm height.See Figure 13, reference 2.The holders are 4.4 mm long, and are slightly narrower than the rest of the cheeks by 0.6 mm, so that they do not cover any part of the third section of the window, but exactly follow its borders. The holders are perforated by a pinhole (still containing remains of the pin).See Figure 13, reference 5.The diameter of the pinhole is 0.7 mm and its center is located 1.1 mm from the plate and 2.1 mm from the beginning of the holder (i.e., from the wall of the holder where the cheek changes its height).We note in passing that the removable pins used here and elsewhere in the Mechanism were evidently composed of a different alloy from the components in which they were inserted, so that pinholes are very conspicuous in the CT whether or not the pins themselves survive (Anastasiou et al. 2014). n nThere is a very clear hemispherical depression where the moon ball ought once to have been (blue in the diagram of Figure 5; see Figure 15). This could be remains of the surface of the moon ball (in which case the ball must either have been hollow or partly covered by some kind of lamination overlaying half of it) or just accretion that assumed this semicircular shape by building up in contact with the missing ball.We find such accretion layers in many places in the Mechanism's fragments; for example, the mirror image inscriptions on fragment A and B are due to accretion against the original inscribed plates (cfr. Price 1974: 47).The diameter of the depression is 6 mm, significantly smaller than the moon ball window.It is roughly centered in the moon ball window. (It is hard to determine the exact center of the moon window because it is damaged.) As we have already said, the arbor protrudes a bit beyond the arbor keeper and projects inside the moon ball window.Nevertheless, the arbor does not quite reach the moon ball depression. But, if we imagine extending the arbor to where the arbor should come into contact for the first time with the moon ball, there is a very small semicircular indentation in the rim of the moon ball depression perfectly lined up with and of about the same size as the arbor, which seems to confirm that the arbor originally went inside the ball (see Figure 16).There is also a slight semicircular depression at the other side that might suggest that the arbor, after going through the entire ball, protruded from it. This depression, however, is less regular and not as well aligned as the previous one, so it may be just a random irregularity. n nInside the arbor window and between the two cheeks and their holders is another component that kept the arbor in place.We will call it the arbor keeper pipe, or simply, the pipe (violet in the diagram of Figure 5).This pipe has a complex shape (somewhat similar to a tobacco pipe with a bowl) that makes it fit perfectly in the space left by the moon window, the cheeks and holders (see Figure 17). It is 14.9 mm long (hence it goes all along the third section of the big window).It is perforated by a cylindrical hole of the same diameter as the arbor, which is inside it (Figure 17, reference 1).The pipe covers the arbor window and slightly protrudes from the outer surface of the cap plate, by about 0.8 mm.On this face it has a regular semi-cylindrical shape.The u201cbowl u201d of the pipe (Figure 17, reference 2), 6.4 mm high and as long as the holders (4.4 mm), is lodged between the two holders and is a bit taller than them (about 1.3 mm). This part covers all the space between the two holders (3.3 mm).It also has a pinhole aligned with the pinhole of the holders and of the same diameter (Figure 17, reference 3).The shape of the sides of the u201cshank u201d of the pipe has been executed in such a way that they perfectly fit with the sides of the window and the part of the cheeks that partially covered the window.Thus, the two vertical walls of the shank have a depression that accommodates the protruding parts of the cheeks (see Figure 13). Part of the depression is finished with little u201cwings u201d that cover the small depressions of the cheeks, so that the exposed top surface of the pipe constitutes a flat tab flush with the exposed top surfaces of the cheeks.There appears to be a second letter Tau shallowly inscribed on the tab, with its top horizontal stroke running along the tab's right edge (Wright 2006: 326 Figure 8).These wings extend from the bowl of the pipe for 4.1 mm (see Figure 14). We already mentioned them when we observed that, because of them, there is a false appearance that the depression of the cheeks did not extend along the whole length of the cheeks.The complete shape of the arbor keeper pipe can be seen in the following animation. n nThis completes our description of the evidence that can be obtained by accurate analysis of the CT.Now we will try to make sense of this description. n nReconstruction of the Mechanism n nThe general way that the moon phase mechanism works is clear and was first correctly described by Michael Wright (2006: 327-329). As we already mentioned, the contrate gear must rotate with the lunar synodic period.The gear is attached to the arbor through a pin and so the arbor also rotates at the same rate.The arbor is held by pipe and transmits its rotation to the moon ball. n nWe will propose a way in which all the parts of the mechanism can be assembled and disassembled that is consistent with the description of the parts and makes sense of some apparently unnecessary complexities in certain pieces (such as the particular shape of the cheeks or of the pipe). See animation 2.In order to disassemble the mechanism: n nYou first have to detach the moon ball.The moon ball was presumably attached to the the part of the arbor inserted in it just by friction or possibly a screw fitting.The small semicircular slot at the moon ball depression where the arbor should go inside the ball (Figure 16) shows that the arbor was still cylindrical when went inside the ball (this would have allowed one to twist the ball by hand when the apparatus was assembled and all the gears connected, in order to set up the correct phase). Because the moon ball is smaller than the moon ball window, the ball could be taken off by drawing it in the opposite direction of the arbor. n nThen you have to remove the pin that goes through the holders and the pipe.Steps 1 and 2 could be reversed, but both must be completed before step 3. n nThe third step consists in removing the entire apparatus: i.e., the pipe with the arbor and the contrate. The walls of the pipe are as wide as the space left by the third section of the moon window, but the window is partially closed by the cheeks, which thus prevent the pipe from being pushed through to the inner side of the plate.On the other hand, the wings of the pipe prevent it from being pushed through towards the outer side of the plate.Consequently, even if the pin is removed, the pipe cannot be moved up or down. But, now that the pin and the moon ball have been removed, the pipe can be slid in the direction of the moon window using the protruded part of the cheeks as guides.If the pipe is moved in this way until it abuts the rim of the cap, the part of the shank of the pipe that has wings would be now partially in the moon ball window and partially in the part of the third section window where the holders are, and so the cheeks would not stand in the way of moving the pipe to the outer side of the plate. It is important to realize that even now it can only be removed in the direction of the outer part and not towards the inner part of the plate, because the shank still is wider than the space left by the cheeks. n nOnce the pipe, together with the arbor and the gear, has been removed from the moon cap, you can extract the arbor by drawing it in the direction of the gear (you cannot remove it in the other direction because the squared collar obstructs it). n nFinally you can remove the pin that fixes the gear to the arbor and take off the gear (the order of steps 4 and 5 can be reversed). The whole mechanism is now disassembled.You can reassemble the mechanism following the steps in the reverse order. n nSection 2: the direction of the contrate gear n nIn this section we will analyse in detail whether, as Wright suggested, the contrate gear was reassembled incorrectly so that the actual direction of the contrate gear is not the originally intended one, or whether the extant direction was the intended one so that we would have to postulate (at a minimum) two extra gears to connect the contrate gear to the Sun's arbor, as Freeth suggested. n nWe note in passing that that the supposed incorrect assembly must have taken place before the discovery of the shipwreck and not, say, during handling or conservation of the fragment at the Museum. The earliest known photograph of the face of Fragment C bearing the Moon phase apparatus, published by Svoronos in 1903, shows it before any conservation work had been done on it, and the contrate gear is clearly visible pointing in the extant direction (see Figure 18).It also seems very unlikely that an inversion of the gear could have happened during the shipwreck or during the time the Mechanism was under the sea. The perfect alignment of the pinhole of the arbor and the pin slot of the contrate on one side, and the almost perfect alignment of the two pieces of the arbor on each side of the break make the notion that the contrate gear was somehow flipped around just by chance highly implausible.The incorrect assembly must have taken place before the shipwreck, when the Mechanism was essentially intact. n nIn Figure 19 we schematically represent the parts that would play a role in this analysis in the extant position, i.e., with the contrate gear teeth facing the moon ball. n nIf one wants to assert that the gear has been reversed before the shipwreck there are three options. The first two can be easily dismissed by consideration of the evidence, but the third one will require a more detailed analysis.The first option consists of reconstructing the intended arrangement of the moon phase mechanism by leaving all as in Figure 19 except the gear, which would face the other way around.But, as is evident from Figure 20, if you keep the pinhole of the arbor aligned with the slot of the gear so that the pin can be inserted, the gear would not fit inside the gear-window of the moon cap. An additional problem is that the gear would be too close to the sun axis to leave room for a gear with the same number of teeth that would move the contrate gear. n nThe second option assumes that the collar was movable.According to this possibility, the collar would have originally been between the contrate and edge a of the window.This option would make all the components fit within the cap window. The collar would have had to have a hole for a pin (d in Figure 21) that, passing through the collar and the extant pinhole of the arbor, would fix the collar.Also, the arbor would have to have had another pinhole (e in Figure 21) for a second pin that, passing through it and the rectangular slot in the gear, would prevent the gear from moving to the right.The absence of any traces of a boundary between the collar and the arbor, and above all of a second pinhole in the arbor at e or of a pinhole through the collar rules out this option, since, as previously noted, the pinholes in the Mechanism are conspicuous in the CT whether their pins are still present or not. n nThe third option takes advantage of the break between surfaces b and c. According to this proposal, in its original position the gear was reversed together with the broken part of the arbor between a and b and the collar attached to it (see Figure 22).Through some accident the arbor was broken, and after this happened, someone put the broken piece with the contrate back in its part of the window pointing the wrong way. n nThe main problems that we find with this proposal are the following. First, a close inspection of the CT tends to confirm that there is a reasonably good matching break between b and c.See Figure 23. n nSecond, in the incorrect assembly hypothesis the most reasonable reconstruction suggests that the squared collar would have been at the left extremity of the arbor.Because the collar was one piece with the arbor, it doesn u2019t make sense for the arbor to protrude beyond the collar. Hence the little window that we identified as the first section of the big window would be pointless, as shown in Figure 24: n nOn the other hand, according to the hypothesis that the contrate is preserved in its intended orientation, it is perfectly reasonable for a bit of the arbor to protrude beyond the gear window so that the pinhole in the arbor does not have to be too close to its end and so more liable to damage. The fact that the gear, instead of having a hole for the pin, has a slot could indicate that a hole so close to the edge would be very fragile.The same would be the case with an arbor that was as long as the gear, but not more. n nThird, if the pinhole of the arbor was so close to the break, one would have expected the arbor have broken through the pinhole, since this was the most fragile part the arbor. n nFourth, there are distinct remains of the cylindrical arbor at the collar. In the following CT image the circle left by the joining of the squared collar and the cylindrical arbor is perfectly identifiable.It is clear from the CT that we are seeing surface b and not surface c. n nFifth, a close inspection of the break shows that it probably includes some little parts of the pipe itself, and not just the arbor.It would be very hard to explain on the incorrect reassembly hypothesis why the little broken pieces of the pipe are still in place. These broken parts of the pipe can be observed in two places.See Figure 26 and Figure 27. n nSixth, if the contrate originally faced the center of the moon cap and then you attempted to reverse its orientation, the teeth of the gear attached to the solar arbor that originally moved the contrate would obstruct replacing the moon cap in its original place, because the back of the contrate would collide with its teeth.9 So, there are three possibilities. One is that the moon cap was never reinstalled on the Mechanism after the contrate gear was unintentionally reversed.But this is implausible, first because the moon cap is extant in fragment C, close to the zodiac and calendar rings, and second because the cap faces in the correct direction with respect to the outer part of the mechanism and the inscribed part of the rings face, which seems to indicate that it was in place at the moment of the shipwreck. Secondly, someone might have tried to force the cap into place, causing still more damage (as suggested by Wright 2006: 327), but this requires that the person responsible, feeling the resistance, was too careless to look for what was wrong and notice the obvious fact that the contrate was facing the wrong way to engage with the other gear.The third possibility is that the moon cap was indeed reassembled, but the gear attached to the solar arbor was for some unexplained reason also missing, but this is clearly an ad hoc hypothesis. (This objection would also apply to the second hypothesis involving a removable collar and second pin.) n nSeventh, we should ask how it is that the broken part is in its place, so very well aligned with the rest of the arbor. We know that the part of the arbor closer to the moon ball was kept in place by the pipe, but the broken part of the arbor, the collar and the contrate gear itself would have had nothing to keep them in place.They ought to have fallen out. n nThese are the main difficulties of the incorrect assembly hypothesis.But our proposal also presents at least one difficulty with respect to the physical remains. If the extant position is the intended one, we have to postulate some additional lost gearwork to connect the solar arbor's motion to the contrate, most plausibly two extra gears, as Freeth suggested.But it seems that there is no trace of the loss of a part on which the arbor for the two extra gears could have been planted, and it is reasonable to think that it should have left a detectable trace. Based on his own study of the original fragment C, Wright has made the same point in connection with both Freeth u2019s reconstruction and the one discussed here (private communication).However, we see two possible ways that the extra gears could have been mounted, either by a platform soldered to the top faces of the cheeks (see Figure 29) or by an attachment to the curb whose footprint remains on the plate (see Figure 28). n nA further reason for suspecting the presence of the two gears (or at least of something where the two extra gears should be) is the way in which the pipe is assembled and disassembled. We have already explained that, while the pin of the pipe must be removed from the inner part of the cap, the pipe has been designed in such a way that it could only be removed towards the outer part of the cap.In principle it would have been easier to remove both pieces from the same side.So, the fact that the pipe was designed to be removed to the outer face of the cap strongly suggests the presence of something in the inner part, blocking the passage of the pipe. See again animation 3 which is essentially similar to animation 2, but with the proposed gears added. n nIn conclusion, all the evidence seems to indicate that the arbor was broken after the shipwreck and that the extant position is the original and intended position.In what follows I will show that the Antikythera mechanism's maker could have had a good reason for putting the gear in this position. n nSection 3: non-uniform motion of the moon phase ball. n nFreeth u2019s proposal consists of two pairs of gears having an equal number of teeth. Fortunately, we have another example of this in the mechanism: the pin and slot device for producing the lunar anomalistic motion.The pin and slot device does not change the period of rotation, but produces a non-uniform motion in the output gear (see Figure 30).Gears z and y have the same number of teeth, as do gears u and x. u moves x by engagement, and x moves y by means of a pin inserted in a slot of y. Therefore, x and y rotate at the same rate but, because y is eccentric with respect to x, its motion is not uniform.This non-uniform motion is transmitted by engagement from y to z.Consequently z rotates at the same rate as u, but with a non-uniform motion.The amplitude of the non-uniformity depends on the eccentricity and its period is the period of rotation of x and y. n nProposals have recently been published for extending the pin and slot device to produce the retrograde motion of outer and inner planets.10 It is thus possible that the pin and slot device was not exclusively employed for the lunar anomaly. If the designer intended to model some anomalistic period in the rotation of the moon ball, through the use of a pin and slot device, we would have an explanation for the presence of the two extra gears of Freeth u2019s arrangement (see Figure 31). n nThis conjectural pin-and-slot device would produce an anomaly with period equal to the synodic month in the rotation of the moon phase ball, without affecting the motion of the moon pointer (i.e., the lunar sidereal motion). So, we should ask: do we know of any ancient report of some sort of anomaly in the lunar phases with a period of a synodic month, independent of the lunar sidereal motion? n nThe answer is affirmative.We know from Aristarchus of Samos u2019s On Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon (Heath 1913) that, if we accept that the ratio between the Earth-Sun distance and the Earth-Moon distance is not too great, there would be a perceptible inequality in the moon u2019s phases. Aristarchus distinguished the dichotomy (when the boundary between the moon's dark and illuminated parts appears to be a straight line) from the quadrature (when the moon is exactly 90 u00b0 elongation from the sun).According to Aristarchus, the dichotomy is not produced at quadrature, but 3 u00b0 earlier at first quarter and 3 u00b0 later at last quarter (see Figure 32). n nIf this appearance were to be modelled in the mechanism, the motion of the moon ball would have to be non-uniform: it should take more time to go from the first dichotomy to second dichotomy than from second to first. The difference between these two intervals, according to Aristarchus u2019s proposal, would be around 1 day. n nAristarchus u2019s ratio between the Earth-Sun distance and the Earth-Moon distance is not the only one attested in ancient texts, and in fact, together with that of Ptolemy (for whom it was almost the same), it is one of the greatest.Of course, the smaller the ratio, the bigger the effect. So, for example, for Eudoxus the ratio was 9:1, implying a difference between quadrature and dichotomy of more than 6 u00b0; for Phidias, Archimedes u2019s father, 12:1, implying a difference of almost 5 u00b0; for Eratosthenes the ratio is a bit bigger than 5:1, implying a difference of almost 11 u00b0; and for Hipparchus, it is approximately 7:1, implying a difference of almost 8 u00b0.11 See the following animation based on Phidias u2019s proportion. n nA one-day difference could be observed on the Mechanism. One would move the moon pointer until the moon ball shows the dichotomy, note which day is indicated on the Egyptian calendar scale (or on the day-of-the-month display, if such display existed, as has been proposed)12, then crank the mechanism forward to the next dichotomy and check the date.Of course, a crucial question is whether it could be possible to distinguish the dichotomy on the moon ball within one single day. Two independent observations have been made with different reconstructions of the mechanism, and in both cases the answer was positive.13 Moreover, the observations have been made assuming the maximum attested ratio of the distances (that of Aristarchus), but if the ratio between the distances was smaller, then the effect would be even greater and, therefore, easier to be detected. n nWe must stress that if the Mechanism's designer adopted Freeth's extra pair of gears, or indeed any means of transmitting motion from the solar arbor to the moon ball's arbor that was more complicated than the obvious direct engagement of the contrate with the fixed gear as proposed by Wright, it must have been intended somehow to modify the motion that direct engagement would have produced. The only possibilities are a modification of the period, which is out of the question for a display of the lunar phases, or a periodic modification of the moon ball's rate of rotation u2014in other words, a modification of the symmetrical periodic function that would otherwise correlate the appearance of the lunar phase to the moon's elongation from the sun. (Strictly, we should not speak without qualification of a change from uniform to non-uniform motion, since the elongation displayed on the Mechanism was already affected by the lunar anomaly, though likely not by the solar anomaly14.) And the only historically plausible anomalistic effect would have been the one produced by the ratio of the distances of the sun and moon. Incorporating this effect would have provided a way of including one of the main topics of ancient astronomy at least since Aristotle u2019s time, the distances of the luminaries, which would not otherwise have been present in the mechanism.Their relative distances would have been displayed qualitatively by the fact that the moon ball was closer to the dial's center (representing the earth) than the golden little sphere that apparently was mounted on the sun's pointer, but it would have been impracticable to set these spheres at the assumed ratio of their distances. If the Antikythera mechanism was intended as a teaching device (Jones 2012), a moon phase anomalistic device would thus have been a suitable springboard for explaining the luminaries' distances. n nPreviously, the pin and slot device has only been suggested as a mechanical expression of an epicyclic or eccentric geometrical system, which have no obvious relevance for lunar phases.There is, however, an isomorphism between the mechanical and the astronomical configuration. Figure 16 represents the hypothetical pin and slot device for producing the moon phase anomaly, considered in a frame of reference such that the axes E of the driving gear and M of the driven gear are stationary.The pin, S, thus revolves around axis E uniformly (relative to the motion that directly drives it) with the synodic period.The slot (in dashed lines) revolves around the other axis, M, with the same period, but with a non-uniform motion. The non-uniform motion of the slot represents the moon phase anomaly.This mechanical configuration has an astronomical interpretation: E represents the Earth; M, the Moon, and S, the Sun, in a frame of reference such that the Earth and Moon are both stationary, so that the Sun revolves around the Earth at a rate equal to the difference between its own sidereal speed and the moon's sidereal speed, i.e. with the lunar synodic period. The angle that represents the moon's phases is angle SME, i.e., the angle at the Moon between the Earth and the Sun, and the rate of increase of this angle incorporates a non-uniformity because the Sun revolves around the Earth and not around the Moon.In order to produce the correct anomaly, the proportion between the interaxial distance ME and the distance between the pin, S and its axis, E, should be the same as the proportion between the Earth-Moon distance and the Earth-Sun distance. The isomorphism is perfect. n nIf this proposal is correct, then it shows the pin and slot device in a new and interesting light.Recently James Evans and one of us suggested that the epicycle and deferent system could have been originated using the pin and slot as an inspiration and not the other way around (Evans and Carman 2013).According to that proposal, pin and slot devices were conceived as a mechanical solution for producing anomalistic motions in geared mechanisms and then, looking at it, some geometer proposed the epicycle and deferent system. The use of the pin and slot for the moon phase would show some independence of the pin and slot device from the epicycle and deferent system: in some sense, the pin and slot device is even more versatile than the epicycle and deferent system, for it could be used for producing anomalies that could not be represented by epicycles. n nAcknowledgements n nWe are very grateful to the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project for preparing the x-ray slices of Fragment C that we used in this study and for the permission (via Professor Mike Edmunds) to reproduce the images here.

This paper discusses both the astronomical and astrological details of Berl. 9825, enumerating its contents and situating it within the broader historical and cultural context of astrological material from western antiquity.The first section outlines the physical details of the papyrus, its paleography, and the layout of the material among the different sections of the papyrus.It consists of seventeen columns spread among four framed sections. The beginning of the papyrus is lost, but enough remains to allow reconstruction of the date and time of the horoscope, in addition to the positions of the missing luminaries and planet (Saturn). A transcription and translation with apparatus and textual notes follow. A commentary in three parts follows the first section.Part 1 contains restorations, confirmations and corrections.This includes both a tabular summary of the data given in the horoscope, and a diagrammatic representation of the data. Part 2 consists of an astronomical commentary, comparing the astronomical data in the papyrus with Ptolemy u2019s Almagest and modern theory, to demonstrate that the horoscope was constructed using tables distinct from Ptolemy's, though of comparable quality.The commentary also includes analysis of solar and lunar data, planetary latitudes, and fixed stars u201cco-rising u201d with the longitudes of the relevant heavenly body. Part 3 is an astrological commentary.Comparisons with other elaborate horoscopes are made, in addition to analysis of the astrological techniques based on the data provided.Because this is the only extant example of a documentary horoscope containing all seven of the u201cplanetary u201d lots of Paulus Alexandrinus, there is a more extensive discussion of the lots used here within their historical and cultural context.Contents n nIntroduction n nText n nApparatus n nTranslation n nCommentary n nPart I: Restorations, confirmations, and corrections. n nPart II: Astronomical commentary. n nPart III: Astrological commentary n nNotes n nManuscripts n nBibliography n nIntroduction n nElaborate horoscopes n nThe surviving corpus of about 350 currently known Greek horoscopes, comprising roughly equal numbers of original documents from antiquity and exemplary horoscopes preserved through the medieval manuscript tradition, is collectively an invaluable source of data relating to the practices of personal astrology and astronomical calculation in the Greco-Roman world.1 Considered singly, on the other hand, few of these horoscopes stand out as especially informative documents for the historian. Most are what we might call u201cminimal u201d horoscopes, recording no more than the individual u2019s name, birthdate, and birthtime and the zodiacal signs occupied by the Sun, Moon, planets, and ascendant at that date and time. A horoscope of this type frequently called for only a small ticket-like piece of papyrus. n nThe remaining minority of horoscopes go beyond the minimal format by providing greater precision in the data, or more kinds of data, or both. Greater precision typically means specifying longitudes of heavenly bodies and astrologically significant points in degrees (with or without fractions) rather than just by zodiacal signs.Additional data may be strictly astronomical, such as latitudes of heavenly bodies, cardines other than the ascendant, or dates and longitudes of syzygies close to the birthdate, or astrological, such as lots and dignities.2 A few types of additional data, for example cardines or house rulers, may appear in horoscopes that specify only zodiacal signs without degrees, but most depended on knowledge of precise longitudes in degrees, and hence only appear in horoscopes that also give that additional precision in the longitudes. n nFour papyrus horoscopes in Neugebauer and Van Hoesen u2019s Greek Horoscopes, all for birthdates within a span of about a half century from the late first century CE to the mid second, exemplify a loose genre that can be characterized as u201celaborate u201d or u201cdeluxe u201d horoscopes (years cited in this paper are CE unless otherwise indicated):3 n nP.Lond. 1.130 (Hor. gr. 81.III.31 = GH 81), 81 April 1 n nP.Lond. 1.98 (Hor. gr. 95.IV.13 = GH 95), 95 April 13 n nP.Lond. 1.110 and Paris 19 (Hor. gr. 137.XII.4 = GH 137b and 137a), 137 December 4 n nP.Paris 19bis (Hor. gr. 137.XII.4 = GH 137c), 137 December 4 n n(Lond. 1.110 and Paris 19 are two copies of the same text, whereas Paris 19bis is a different horoscope with respect to both the wording and the data though computed for the same individual u2019s birthdate.) In comparison to the general run of papyrus horoscopes, these elaborate horoscopes stand out in the first instance on account of their scale, since they are composed as prose texts u2014not mere lists of data u2014that take up more than one column of a length of papyrus roll, while giving precise longitudes in degrees as well as an abundance of astrological data. A hard-and-fast definition of what constitutes an elaborate horoscope is not a straightforward matter, because each example differs in details of expression and in the range of data. A reasonable working criterion, however, would be the inclusion of the planetary rulers of the terms ( u1f45 u03c1 u03b9 u03b1) occupied by the heavenly bodies and astrologically significant points, since these are provided in all four roll-format horoscopes cited above and, when they appeared at all in a horoscope, they would have been frequent enough to be likely to occur even in a comparatively small surviving fragment. Defining them in this way, we can currently identify 26 elaborate papyrus horoscopes, roughly half of which have a preserved or deducible birthdate while the rest are only roughly datable, usually by paleography:4 n nExact birthdate known n nP.Oxy. 2.307 (Hor. gr. 46.3 = GH 46), 46 January 3 n nP.Oxy. 31.2555 (Hor. gr. 46.13 = OG 46), 46 May 13 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4236 (Hor. gr. 63.XI.25), 63 November 25 n nP.Lond. 1.130 (Hor. gr. 81.IV.1 = GH 81), 81 April 1 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4237 (Hor. gr. 84.IX.6), 84 September 6 n nP.Lond. 1.98 (Hor. gr. 95.IV.13 = GH 95), 95 April 13 n nP.Lond. 1.110 and Paris 19 (Hor. gr. 137.XII.4 = GH 137b and 137a), 137 December 4 n nP.Paris 19bis (Hor. gr. 137.XII.4 = GH 137c), 137 December 4 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4245 (Hor. gr. 218.XI.27), 218 November 27/28 n nP.Berl. 9825 (Hor. gr. 319.XI.18-19), 319 November 19 n nPSI 1.23,a (Hor. gr. 338.XII.24 = GH 338), 338 December 24 n nP.Kellis 1.84 (Hor. gr. 373.16), 373 May 16 5 n nP.Oxy. 65.4477 (Hor. gr. 430.VII.8), 430 July 7 n nRoughly dated n nP.Oxy. astr. 4279 (Hor. gr. 50-150a), c. 100 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4280 (Hor. gr. 50-150b), c. 100 n nP.Princ. 2.75 (Hor. gr. 138-161= GH 138/161), 138-161 (reign of Antoninus Pius) n nP.Oxy. astr. 4281 (Hor. gr. 100-200a), c. 150 n nP.Berl. 21347 (no Hor. gr. number), c. 150 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4276 (Hor. gr. 150-250a), c. 200 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4277 (Hor. gr. 150-250b), c. 200 n nP.Ryl. 3.524 (Hor. gr. 200-300?b = GH 250,2, c. 250 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4285 (Hor. gr. 200-300c), c. 250 n nP.Lips. inv. 414 ined.

The papyrus horoscope discussed in the present article, Berl. inv. 9825, meets these conditions to an exceptional degree.7 n nAt present Berl. 9825 is mounted in four glass frames designated A through D (Figs. 2-5).The parts in A (42.5 x 27.0 cm), B (38.6 x 27.4 cm), and C (40.5 x 27.6 cm) were originally continuous, in that order from left to right, and their joining edges are mostly preserved, forming an aggregate stretch of roll of dimensions 119.3 x 27.6 cm. The part in D (25.7 x 26.6 cm) was certainly to the right of that in C, but their edges do not join, though it is doubtful whether much is missing between them.Assuming that the lost column pertaining to the Sun and the incomplete one for the Moon (i) were the same width as the columns for the planets and nodes (ii-vii), the complete horoscope was at least 164 cm wide, not counting margins u2014more if there was an introductory section to the left of the Sun u2019s column. The upper and lower margins are intermittently preserved to respectively about 4 cm and 3 cm from the top and bottom rulings containing the horoscope.According to the records of the Berlin papyrus collection, the greater part of Berl. 9825 was purchased by Otto Rubensohn in 1902 from the Papyrus Fund ; additionally four fragments in frame A (now joined) were obtained as a gift from the Su00e4chsische Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften, and one as part of an exchange with the Giessen papyrus collection. We thus have no information about the precise provenance, beyond the fact (shown in the astronomical commentary below) that the ascendant of the horoscope was computed for a locality on the parallel through Syeneu2014which of course tells us where the native was born but not necessarily where the horoscope itself was composed.The horoscope is written in a neat but not calligraphic hand, consistent with the fourth century dating we will deduce from the contents. Words are separated by, but also sometimes rather capriciously split by, spaces; occasional rising diagonal strokes function as quasi-punctuation marking ends of sentences or sections.Phonetic deviations from standard orthography are frequent, for example u03b1u03b9u2194u03b5, u03b5u03b9u2194u03b9.The text is mostly written out, though with one instance each of common abbreviations or symbols for u03bcu03bfu1fd6u03c1u03b1u03b9 (degrees), u03bbu03b5u03c0u03c4u03ac (minutes), u1f61u03c1u03bfu03c3u03bau03ccu03c0u03bfu03c2 (ascendant), and u03f9u03b5u03bbu03aeu03bdu03b7 (Moon). The horoscope, so far as it is preserved, can be divided according to its layout into four parts, each of which is contained in a tabular framework ruled in red.The first part comprises columns i through vi, and is divided vertically into three roughly equal registers.Each column contains data pertaining to one of the Moon and five planets.The top register gives a string of astronomical and astrological data concerning the heavenly bodys longitude; the middle one gives astronomical data concerning its latitude; and the bottom register gives astronomical data concerning a fixed star in the zodiacal belt that was close in longitude to the heavenly body. The second part comprises column vii, and has two registers, pertaining respectively to the ascending and descending node of the Moon; their contents are similar to those of the top register in cols. i-vi.The third part is a table of ten columns of varying width (viii-xvii) and eighteen rows.The top four rows give data concerning the four cardines; then, following a header row, come seven rows with data concerning seven lots; of the remaining six rows, two contain astronomical data concerning the Moon while the other four are vacant. The last part, comprising col. xviii, contains astronomical and astrological data concerning the full Moon immediately preceding the nativity, further astrological data concerning the nativity, and a closing formula.Part I: Restorations, confirmations, and corrections.The first part of our horoscope is missing, including any introductory information such as the name of the native, the date and place for which the horoscope was computed, the entire section devoted to the Sun, and nearly the whole section devoted to the Moon. Elsewhere some items of information are lost to holes, abrasion, and staining, or only partially legible, and what can be read may sometimes be affected by errors committed by the copyist or the original composer of the horoscope.Fortunately large parts of the text follow a repetitive formulaic structure, some missing data can be deduced from astronomical considerations, and most of the astrological data were derived from the astronomical data according to identifiable rules that can be put into reverse. The first part of our commentary is primarily concerned with restoring and, where necessary, correcting the data relating to the longitudes of the heavenly bodies and astrologically significant points; and the date, time, and geographical locality of the nativity.Further discussion of the astronomical and astrological data in their own right will follow in parts II and III respectively.The longitudes were expressed as zodiacal sign, degrees, and minutes. The other information in the horoscope derived from the longitudes included the following: The house ruler.This was one of the Sun, Moon, and five planets, according to a recognized scheme that assigned one complete zodiacal sign to each of the Sun and Moon, and two to each of the planets.Thus knowing the house ruler identifies the sign itself either uniquely or as one of a pair.Our horoscope is very reliable with respect to house rulers. The terms ruler.Terms (u1f45u03c1u03b9u03b1, literally, boundaries ) were subdivisions of irregular length of the zodiacal signs, each having one of the five planets as its ruler.Our horoscope reliably follows the so-called Egyptian system of terms, which was by far the most commonly used of the several attested systems and which is completely known from multiple sources.If the zodiacal sign is known, knowing the terms ruler narrows the longitude to a range of degrees within the sign. The monomoiria.Each degree of a zodiacal sign was assigned to one of the seven heavenly bodies according to the following scheme.The first degree had the same ruler as the sign taken as a whole, while the rulers of the subsequent degrees cycled through the standard, so-called Chaldean order Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon.Thus if the zodiacal sign is known, knowing the monomoiria limits the longitude to a set of four or five single degrees spread out at intervals of seven degrees. Our horoscope is usually reliable with respect to monomoiriai, but there is one clear instance of error.The triplicity (or trigon).Each set of three zodiacal signs at intervals of four signs forms a triplicity, ruled by one of the seven heavenly bodies for diurnal nativities and another for nocturnal.Since the rulers given for the triplicities in our horoscope frequently conflict with the standard system, we have not made use of this information to establish or confirm the zodiacal signs. The dodekatemorion.This is a variety of scheme that associates either twelve or thirteen equal divisions of each sign of the zodiac with one of the zodiacal signs.The particular scheme used in our horoscope, as we infer from the data, takes the degrees of the longitude, disregarding the minutes, multiplies by thirteen, and counts the product from the beginning of the zodiacal sign to find the sign of the dodekatemorion. The dodekatemoria appear to have been consistently computed correctly.Exaltations and depressions.Each of the seven heavenly bodies has its exaltation in one zodiacal sign, and its depression in the diametrically opposite sign, according to a standardized system.Knowledge that a sign is the exaltation or depression of a particular body determines the sign.In our horoscope this information is reliable. Nearby fixed star.The bottom register of each column of the horoscopes first part names a star that is close to the heavenly body.If the star is identifiable, it determines the bodys longitude within a few degrees.Lots.Lots are astrologically significant longitudes equal to a sum or difference involving the ascendant and some subset of the longitudes of the heavenly bodies.Our horoscope presents a system of seven lots whose formulas are given by Paulus Alexandrinus. The lots determine precise relations among the longitudes.The computations of lots in our horoscope have apparently been carried out carefully.The papyrus preserves complete statements of the longitudes of Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, the ascendant, and the ascending and descending nodes.Saturns zodiacal sign can be deduced to be Aries, which together with Scorpio has Mars as its house ruler and which is the exaltation of the Sun and depression of Saturn. The Moon must be within a few degrees of its mean longitude, given as Cancer 24u00b0 3', and the Sun within thirty degrees of Mercury and within sixty degrees of Venus, say between Scorpio 15u00b0 and Sagittarius 30u00b0.Hence we have the following low precision data for establishing the date of the horoscope: SaturntAries JupitertVirgo MarstScorpio VenustLibra (end) MercurytSagittarius SuntBetween Scorpio 15u00b0 and Sagittarius 30u00b0 MoontCancer Ascending nodetScorpio AscendanttVirgo With the Sun in Scorpio or Sagittarius and the ascendant in Virgo, this is obviously a nocturnal nativity. We can narrow down the possible dates using the usual strategy for simple undated horoscopes, beginning with the combination of Saturns and Jupiters positions.8 Limiting consideration on the basis of the papyruss paleography to years between 200 and 500 CE, and allowing generous margins beyond the sign boundaries, the combination Saturn in Aries, Jupiter in Virgo would be possible for the following years:9 201-202, 260-261, 319-321, 379-380, 438-439, 497-498 For each of these years, we inspect the longitudes of Mars and the ascending node on November 20, around the middle of the span of less than two months possible for the Sun. In a single month Mars cannot move an entire sign, while the Moons nodes shift by less than two degrees.Since we are not testing for very precise agreement, we have used the theories of Ptolemys Almagest to test each of the listed years because of the convenience of Robert van Gents Almagest Ephemeris Calculator for making such comparisons.10 Only for 319 do we find a satisfactory match for both Mars and the node. Taking into account the signs occupied by Venus, Mercury, and the Moon, we can narrow the possible dates down to November 17-19.To obtain further precision, we exploit the formulas for calculating the Lot of Fortune u03bbFortune and the Lot of Daimon u03bbDaimon from the longitudes of the ascendant (u03bbH), the Sun (u03bbu2609), and the Moon (u03bbu263e) for a nocturnal nativity: u03bbFortune = u03bbH + u03bbu2609 u2013 u03bbu263e u03bbDaimon = u03bbH + u03bbu263e u2013 u03bbu2609 This gives us the elongation of the Moon from the Sun, (u03bbu263e u2013 u03bbu2609), as 241u00b0 22', while incidentally securing the uncertainly read numeral for the degrees of the Lot of Fortune. According to the Almagest theories, this elongation was attained, to the nearest equinoctial hour, on November 19 at about two equinoctial hours after midnight for the meridian of Alexandria.For this date and time, we compare data computed by the theories of the Almagest with the papyrus (Table 1).Table 1.Astronomical data computed from Ptolemys Almagest for 319 CE, November 19, 2 equinoctial hours after midnight (meridian of Alexandria, mean time according to the Era Nabonassar) compared with data from Berl. 9825.

Saturns dodekatemorion is stated to be in Taurus; this could only be true for a longitude whose whole number part is 3u00b0 or 4u00b0.The precise longitude can be determined as Aries 3u00b0 43' from the formula for the Lot of Nemesis for a nocturnal nativity: u03bbNemesis = u03bbH + u03bbu2644 u2013 u03bbFortune In the case of Jupiter, the stated longitude, Virgo 7u00b0 40', conflicts with Mercury as the terms ruler (valid in Virgo only for longitudes less than or equal to 6u00b0) and with Jupiter as ruler of the monomoiria (valid for 3u00b0 + 7i< u03bb u2264 4u00b0 + 7i, i = 0, 1, 2, or 3). From the formula for the Lot of Victory for a nocturnal nativity, u03bbVictory = u03bbH + u03bbDaimon u2013 u03bbu2643 we find Jupiters longitude as Virgo 3u00b0 40', consistent with the other astrologial data derived from the longitude.The figure 7u00b0 in the papyrus must be a copying error (zeta instead of gamma).The Moons dodekatemorion fell in Gemini, so that the whole number part of its longitude was either 26u00b0 or 27u00b0. Even at the beginning of this range this would imply an equation greater than +1u00b0 57' where the Almagest gives +1u00b0 41', so we may assume that the longitude was not much greater than Cancer 26u00b0.The data provided for the preceding full Moon provide us with another check on the solar and lunar longitudes.According to the papyrus, the exact opposition took place on Hathyr 17 (November 14) at the 7th seasonal houru2014undoubtedly of day, though the indication of this is illegibleu2014with the Sun at Scorpio 20u00b0 30' and the Moon at Taurus 20u00b0 30'. Since the nativity was roughly four and a half days later, the Suns longitude at the nativity should have been within a few minutes of Scorpio 25u00b0 0', and (adding the known elongation) the Moons should have been within a few minutes of Cancer 26u00b0 22'.With an approximate value for the Suns longitude, we can use the ascendant to get a more accurate estimate of the time of the nativity as well as the terrestrial latitude for which the horoscope was computed, on the hypotheses that the time was a whole number of seasonal hours past sunset and that trigonometrical tables comparable to Ptolemys were used to determine the cardines. For a chosen latitude, we find the oblique ascensions of the ascendant (u03c1H) and of the point diametrically opposite the Sun (u03c1180u00b0u2013u2609) as well as the number of degrees of ascension corresponding to one seasonal hour of night (u03c7).The ascensional difference divided by u03c7 gives the number of seasonal hours past midnight corresponding to the ascendant for the chosen latitude; if it is close to an integer, this is likely to be the correct latitude.

This result implies (1) that the assumed time and place of the nativity were 319 November 19, end of the 7th hour of night, on the parallel through Syene, (2) that the ascension tables were essentially the same as those of the Handy Tables, and (3) that the longitude of the Sun was assumed to be exactly Scorpio 25u00b0 0', either because this was the actual longitude calculated for the date or because the longitude was close enough to a whole number that the computer did not bother to interpolate in the table but merely read of the tabulated value for the nearest whole degree. (If we take the Suns stated longitude at the preceding full Moon and add the Suns progress between that moment and that of the nativity according to the Almagest, we get approximately Scorpio 25u00b0 8'.)According to the table of right ascensions of the Handy Tables, the midheaven corresponding to u03c1H = 159u00b0 5' is Gemini 10u00b0 44'. Unfortunately all that one can be sure of from the papyrus is that the whole number part of the midheavens longitude was 10u00b0 or greater, and that the number of minutes had two digits.Part II: Astronomical commentary.For purposes of comparison with modern theory, we assume (disregarding the effect of the equation of time) that times according to our horoscope as well as according to the Almagest theories are two equinoctial hours later than UT. The time of the nativity derived above is approximately 1.1 equinoctial hours past midnight, and the horoscopes time for the preceding full Moon is approximately 0.9 equinoctial hours past noon.The longitudinal data present in the papyrus or securely restored are compared below with computations for the same dates and times according to the Almagest and according to the modern theory.12 The errors with respect to the JPL figures are in parentheses.

Considering only the five planets, the mean error for the papyrus is u201325', with a standard deviation of 35'; the Almagest mean error is u20131u00b0 49', with standard deviation 39'.The mean error of Ptolemys longitudes is largely due to his defective tropical frame of reference, which is about a degree off for his own time and by the date of the horoscope about a degree and a half off.13 If, as we incline to believe, the longitudes of the horoscope are to be understood as tropical, the planetary tables on which it was based seem to have reflected little error in the frame of reference. On the other hand, the tables for the Sun and Moon appear to have had similar systematic errors to Ptolemys.Perhaps the composer of the horoscope used tables from different sources for the luminaries and for the planets.An alternative possibility worth exploring is that the longitudes in the horoscope are in a sidereal frame of reference.Abundant evidence exists that when Ptolemys tables were used for astrological purposes during the third and fourth centuries, the tropical longitudes obtained from the tables were generally converted to sidereal by adding 8u00b0 minus one-eightieth of a degree for every year since 158 BCE, a formula explicitly reported by Theon of Alexandria as employed by the astrologers of old. 14 For the nativity date, the value of this correction would have been approximately +2u00b0 3', an amount that would more or less cancel out the error of Ptolemys tropical frame of reference. It is conceivable, therefore, that the planetary longitudes in the papyrus look like tropical longitudes in an accurate tropical frame of reference because they are actually sidereal longitudes in a frame of reference that by chance nearly coincided with the true tropical frame of reference in the early fourth century.This hypothesis fails, however, to explain why the longitudes for the Sun and Moon appear to fit Ptolemys inaccurate tropical frame of reference, and moreover our reconstructed computation of the ascendant assumes that the solar longitude was understood as tropical. The synchronization of the longitudinal theories of the Sun and Moon is crucial for obtaining accurate times of94 syzygy.According to the JPL ephemeris, the exact opposition on November 14 occurred less than 20 minutes before the time given in the papyrus, which of course is expressed just as a whole number of seasonal hours; the Almagest theories predict exact opposition about 20 minutes later than the papyrus. A puzzling item in the horoscope is the longitude given for the latitude (u03c0u03bbu03acu03c4u03bfu03f2) of the Moon, Capricorn 18u00b0 3'. Obviously this is not a latitude at all, nor does it have any recognizable relation to the Moons argument of latitude (167u00b0 20' from the northern limit according to the Almagest) or the nodes.We suspect that it represents the longitude of the apogee in an eccentric lunar model.Modern theory puts the lunar apogee at Capricorn 27u00b0 41', while according to the mean motions of the Almagest, this point (which has no direct role in Ptolemys epicyclic model) would have been at Capricorn 25u00b0 29' (error u20132u00b0 12'). Hence if our identification is correct, the error in the apogee (u20139u00b0 38') and the resulting phase error in lunar anomaly of the tables used for the horoscope were considerably greater than Ptolemys.The incorrect designation of this position as the latitude could have resulted from eyeskip in copying a list of data relating to the Moon.We pointed out previously that if the solar tables used for the horoscope gave the same increase in the Suns longitude as the Almagest over the interval between the preceding full Moon and the nativity, the Suns longitude at the nativity should have been about Scorpio 25u00b0 8', and hence, adding the elongation 241u00b0 22', the Moons longitude should have been about Cancer 26u00b0 30'. Subtracting the Moons mean longitude, Cancer 24u00b0 3', we find the Moons equation to be about +2u00b0 27'.Now suppose that the lunar tables used by the horoscopes composer assumed a simple eccentric model, the eccentric counterpart of the preliminary epicyclic model of Almagest Book 4.Entering the Moons argument of anomaly (i.e. the mean Moon minus the apogee), 186u00b0 0', in the table of equations in Book 4 chapter 10, we find an equation of merely +35'. Obviously a simple model, even with a much larger eccentricity, could not have produced an equation of about two and a half degrees.The final lunar model of Almagest Book 5, which accounts for the Moons second anomaly by introducing a rapidly revolving eccenter bearing the epicycle, yields an equation of +1u00b0 36' because Ptolemys special definition of the apogee of the lunar epicycle introduces an adjustment (commonly called the prosneusis in modern discussions) to the argument of anomaly. This correction is dependent on the mean elongation of the Moon from the Sun.The equation, in turn, is dependent on this corrected argument of anomaly and on the mean elongation.Suppose now that the tables used for the horoscope assumed a model that was functionally similar to Ptolemys final model.We may assume that the mean elongation would have been very nearly the same as obtained from the Almagest theory, 238u00b0 37', but, because of the greater phase error, the mean anomaly was 186u00b0 0' instead of 178u00b0 52'. The so-called prosneusis correction, +13u00b0 9', is unchanged, so the corrected argument is 199u00b0 9', and the equation is +2u00b0 32'.Since this is quite close to the value we are looking for, it would appear that our conjecture is correct that the longitude Capricorn 18u00b0 3' in the horoscope refers to the apogee in lunar model in which an eccenter accounted for the first anomaly, and moreover this model also incorporated a correction for the second anomaly in a way not dissimilar from Ptolemys final model. The middle register for the Moon and each of the planets contains a statement about the bodys position and motion in latitude.It comprises three parts: A location statement in the ascent/descent of the south/north (u1f10u03c0u1f76 u03c4u1fc6u03f2 u03c4u03bfu1fe6 u03bdu03bfu03c4u03afu03bfu03c5/u03b2u03bfu03c1u03b5u03afu03bfu03c5 u1f00u03bdu03b1u03b2u03acu03f2u03b5u03c9u03f2/u03bau03b1u03c4u03b1u03b2u03acu03f2u03b5u03c9u03f2).This is probably according to a division of the ecliptic into four quadrants delimited by nodes and northern and southern limits, so that the variables were determined purely by the bodys longitude and the location of the nodes. The latitude expressed in degrees and minutes in a stated direction south or north (u1f61u03f2 u03c0u03c1u1f78u03f2 u03c4u1f70u03f2 u03bcu03b5u03f2u03b7u03bcu03b2u03c1u03afu03b1u03f2/u1f04u03c1u03bau03c4u03bfu03c5u03f2) of the ecliptic.This would have been computed using tables based on a latitudinal model. A qualitative statement about the latitude in the form ascending/descending the south/north (u1f00u03bdu03b1u03b2u03b1u03afu03bdu03c9u03bd/u03bau03b1u03c4u03b1u03b2u03b1u03afu03bdu03c9u03bd u03c4u1f70 u03bdu03ccu03c4u03b9u03b1/u03b2u03ccu03c1u03b5u03b9u03b1) or simply ascending/descending.The trend was likely also determined from the latitudinal model, e.g. by comparing latitudes computed for consecutive days, while the direction, when given, simply repeats information from the second part using a different vocabulary. The Moons descending node is given later in the papyrus as Taurus 9u00b0 40', and, as we have seen, the Moons own longitude was near Cancer 26u00b0 30', so it would have been on the descending quadrant south of the ecliptic.If the maximum lunar latitude was assumed to be 5u00b0 (Ptolemys parameter), an argument of latitude around 166u00b0 50' would yield a latitude of u20134u00b0 52'.Only the whole number of the latitude, 4u00b0, and the indication in the third part that the Moon is moving further south survive on the papyrus. The latitudes and trends (represented by arrows, up meaning northward) ascribed to the planets in the horoscope are summarized below, with comparisons from Ptolemys Almagest and Handy Tables and from modern theory.Table 5.Latitudinal data for planets from papyrus horoscope and Ptolemys Almagest compared.PlanettPapyrustAlmagesttHandy TablestJPL Saturnt+1u00b0 nn' u2193tu20132u00b0 51' u2191tu20132u00b0 48' u2191tu20132u00b0 44' u2191 Jupitert+1u00b0 22'u2193t+1u00b0 9' u2191t+1u00b0 1' u2191t+1u00b0 12' u2191 Marstu20130u00b0 20'u2193tu20130u00b0 1'u2193t+0u00b0 4'u2193tu20130u00b0 14'u2193 Venust+1u00b0 35' u2193t+1u00b0 42' u2193t+1u00b0 34' u2193t+1u00b0 36' u2193 Mercurytu20131u00b0 13' u2191tu20132u00b0 1' u2191tu20131u00b0 41' u2191tu20132u00b0 17' u2191 Saturn was in fact near its southern limit, so that a modest shift in its assumed nodal line would explain why the papyrus has its latitude decreasing, but the indication that it was north of the ecliptic is surely a mistake rather than a reflection of a variant latitudinal model. Similarly Jupiter was close enough to its northern limit so that its computed trend would have been sensitive to the exact placement of the nodal line.In any case, it is obvious that the latitudinal models underlying the data in the papyrus were significantly different from either those of the Almagest or the revised models of the Handy Tables.15 The lowest register identifies a fixed star that rises with the heavenly body. These turn out to be stars in the zodiacal belt, and the principle of their selection seems to have been proximity in longitude, not in oblique ascension; in other words, the composer of the horoscope simply consulted a star catalogue, paying attention only to the stars' longitudes.As we will see, the catalogue was similar or identical to the zodiacal star list in the Handy Tables.The text in the horoscope ( being north/south of the star ) gives the impression that the stated number of degrees and minutes represents a difference in latitude between the star and the heavenly body, but comparison with the Handy Tables list shows that this quantity is simply the stars own latitude. Perhaps u03c4u03bfu1fe6 u1f00u03f2u03c4u03adu03c1u03bfu03f2 ( of the star ) is a confused substitution for u03c4u03bfu1fe6 u03b4u03b9u1f70 u03bcu03adu03f2u03c9u03bd ( of the ecliptic ). u03b2u03b1u03b8u03bcu03ccu03f2, step, as a quasi-unit for the stars' magnitudes (which again simply match Ptolemys) has no parallel of which we are aware; it is unrelated to the use of u03b2u03b1u03b8u03bcu03ccu03f2 for a unit of argument of latiude (equivalent to 15u00b0).16 The Handy Tables list is an adaptation from the catalogue of Almagest Books 7-8 but with many variants in the names assigned to the stars. Instead of absolute longitudes for a specific epoch date, the list gives each stars elongation from Regulus (obtained by subtracting Reguluss Almagest longitude, 122u00b0 30', from the stars Almagest longitude).The stars are not grouped according to the imaginary figures of the constellations but in order of increasing elongation, which is convenient for finding which stars were closest to each heavenly body on a given date. In the absence of a critical edition of the list, we have consulted three early copies, L =Leid. 78 (ff. 142r-145r), F = Laur. plut. 28,26 (ff. 124v-127r), and V = Vat. gr. 1291 (ff. 90v-94v).17 For each of the planets, we give the bodys elongation from Regulus (subtracting the Handy Tables longitude of Regulus for the nativity date, Leo 4u00b0 19' from the bodys horoscope longitude).The stars name as given in the papyrus is followed by the form or forms of the name in the three Handy Tables manuscripts and the Almagest.

Part III: Astrological Commentary This part of our commentary consists of four sections.First, the kinds of astrological data represented in our horoscope will be given.Secondly, a tally will be made of all horoscopes in the extant corpus that include these data.Thirdly, examples of elaborate horoscopes incorporating a variety of data will be compared with our horoscope.Finally, their astrological meaning and context will be examined. Astrological Techniques in Berl. 9825 The astrological significance of this papyrus can scarcely be overstated.It now joins other elaborate (sometimes called u2018deluxe)23 papyri in the extant corpus that apply a number of additional kinds of data (henceforth referred to as technical data ) to the basic horoscopic positions given for the nativity (that is, the zodiacal longitudes u2013 which may include degrees and minutes of the sign u2013 of the planets and luminaries, the Ascendant, and sometimes the Midheaven and other cardines). The information given in the papyrus consists of the following: For the planets, luminaries, and lunar nodes (due to damage, the papyrus lacks information relating to the Sun) Zodiacal longitude Dignities24 (in order of listing): house, terms, triplicity, exaltation/depression Monomoiria Dodekatemorion Latitude Co-rising (paranatellonta) with fixed stars Fixed stars step in magnitude For the cardines: (Ascendant, Midheaven, Setting [Descendant], Lower Midheaven) Zodiacal longitude (degrees and minutes) Dignities: house, terms For the Lots: Fortune, Daimon, Eros, Necessity, Courage, Victory, Nemesis Zodiacal longitude Dignities: house, terms For the Moon only Latitude (apparently an error for longitude of apogee); its house Mean longitude; longitudes house Prenatal full Moon Date of prenatal syzygy Zodiacal longitude Dignities: house, terms, triplicity Monomoiria Dodekatemorion Presiding planet Managing planet Master of the nativity The wealth of information provided by the horoscope is almost unparalleled in the extant corpus of original documentary and literary horoscopes. At present, there are 446 extant horoscopic texts (including our horoscope) surviving from antiquity, as catalogued by Stephan Heilen and including not only Greek (345) and Latin (8) charts but those in Akkadian (30), Demotic Egyptian (51), Coptic (1), Persian (2), Arabic (2, plus 7 unpublished) and Jewish (1).25 Most of these extant horoscopes give only the luminary and planetary positions, the Ascendant, and occasionally the Midheaven, often only by sign, though many include zodiacal longitudes in degrees or degrees and minutes.26 Some include a number of additional technical data (astronomical, astrological, or both) to be used in chart interpretation, in addition to basic information. Frequency of Additional Technical Data in Extant Horoscopes To see how frequently the varieties of technical data given in our horoscope are included in the corpus of extant horoscopes as a whole, we have made a tally of those specifically represented in Berl. 9825, namely: lots, latitudes, fixed stars, the Moons nodes, monomoiriai, dodekatemoria, pre-natal syzygy (new Moon or full Moon), planets presiding/managing, and u2018house-master (oikodespotes).27 Table 6 inventories horoscopes in the currently known corpus that contain technical data, concentrating on those in Greek dated up to the end of late antiquity,28 but excludes our present horoscope in the tally.

The second most frequent category is the prenatal syzygy, with 23, followed by the Moons nodes (18) and the oikodespotes (14). A very few include fixed stars (7), dodekatemoria (7), latitudes (5) or steps (4), presiding and managing planets (4) or monomoiriai (3).We should point out that of the extant horoscopes including additional technical data, most do not include large quantities of them, but concentrate on a few as needed for a specific interpretation. This makes our horoscope even more rare.To illustrate its exceptionality, we shall now look at the commonalities and differences between this and four other elaborate horoscopes of comparable length and content.Elaborate Horoscopes: Examples and Comparisons Only a small number of elaborate horoscopes approach the detail of ours.For a comparison, we shall look at four elaborate horoscopes, pertaining to nativities from the first through the fifth centuries CE (and thus probably composed from the late first through the sixth centuries), that contain at least five types of technical data in addition to the basic longitudes of planets, luminaries and cardines/angles. These include three original horoscopes on papyri and one preserved through the medieval manuscript tradition in multiple copies.Lond. 1.130 (Hor. gr. 81.III.31 = GH 81) This papyrus horoscope is dated to March 31, 81 CE, so was likely calculated in the late first to early second century CE.32 It consists of nine columns and 213 lines, and is completely preserved.Unusually for an original documentary chart, its author, Titus Pitenius, identifies himself in a kind of colophon. It includes the following technical data also occurring in our horoscope: dignities (house, terms, triplicity, exaltation, decan), dodekatemoria, fixed stars, Lot of Fortune, oikodespotes.In addition, it contains information on decans in their Egyptian names, the gender and quadruplicity (tropical, solid, double-bodied) of a planets or luminarys sign, planetary phases in relation to the sun,33 and the number of days of the pregnancy.34 It is similar to our horoscope in terms of length and in the abundance of technical data calculated. There is an emphasis in Lond. 1.130 on the locations of heavenly bodies and the Midheaven in relation to fixed stars or constellations.The wording used for the calculation of the Lot of Fortune is problematic, and has been addressed by both Greenbaum and Heilen.35 The calculation of the house-master (oikodespotes), which turns out to be Mercury, is consistent with the rules of Vettius Valens, Dorotheus and, later, Porphyry.36 Dodekatemoria are calculated (wrongly, as Neugebauer and Van Hoesen correctly note)37 only for the Sun and Moon. Lond. 1.98 (Hor. gr. 95.IV.13 = GH 95) This is another elaborate horoscope containing numerous technical data.Parts of the papyrus are missing or severely damaged; in particular, little remains of what was presumably its first column, comprising an introductory section followed by sections pertaining to the Sun and Moon.The horoscope proper consists of 81 lines.It is immediately followed by a text, large parts of which have been made illegible through erasure, headed Prognostications of the 5 stars [i.e. the planets] concerning life, and comprising 36 lines in Greek and 73 in Egyptian though written in an adaptation of the Greek alphabet ( Old Coptic ). We are not concerned here with this text, which, consisting as it does of extensive statements concerning the life of the native derived from elements of the horoscope, is unparalleled in any other known Greek horoscope on papyrus.Like our horoscope, Lond. 1.98 includes the dignities of house, exaltation and terms, as well as dodekatemoria, latitude, and oikodespotes.Additionally, it distinguishes between bright horoscopes and decans, supplying information for both.38 It claims to have three lots, but these are more likely a reference to places in the chart (the Demotic Egyptian term tny.t, lot, can also mean, in an astrological context, a place, Greek topos).39 Oxy. astr. 4277 (Hor. gr. 150-250b) Dated paleographically (and hence only roughly) to the second half of the second century CE, this incomplete horoscope consists of two fragments, the first with three columns of 40, 35 and 9 lines respectively, and the second containing 5 lines. Included in what remains of the papyrus are the positions and descriptions of Mercury, the Ascendant, Descendant, Midheaven and Lower Midheaven; and the four lots Fortune, Daimon, Eros and Necessity.Horoscopes with these four lots are quite rare in the extant corpus.40 Even as a fragmentary document missing all planetary positions except for Mercury, Oxy. astr. 4277 includes dignities (house, term, triplicity, exaltation, decan), dodekatemoria, monomoiriai, lots, steps and winds, planetary stations and descriptions of the zodiacal signs involved, such as gender and quadruplicity. The Eutocius horoscope (Hor. gr. 497.28 = GH L497) Dated October 28, 497, this horoscope is transmitted complete in two Byzantine Greek manuscripts, Laur.Plut. 28,34 ff. 141v-143v, and Par. gr. 2425 ff. 216v-219v, under the title From the astrological writings [u1f00u03c3u03c4u03c1u03bfu03bbu03bfu03b3u03bfu03c5u03bcu03adu03bdu03c9u03bd] of Eutocius, and abridged in a few other manuscripts without the attribution to Eutocius.41 Its author is presumably Eutocius of Ascalon (fl. early sixth century CE), the author of extant commentaries on mathematical works of Archimedes and editor of a recension (with commentaries) of Books 1-4 of Apolloniuss Conics.42 The introductory passage indicates that the horoscope is offered as an example of how the computation of a chart should be set out; in other words, it is a didactic model that, unlike most horoscopes provided in ancient astrological treatises, is meant to illustrate not techniques of astrological prognostication but rather the format appropriate for an elaborate horoscope.43 It is in fact one of the most elaborate horoscopes we have. The technical data which match those in our horoscope are: dignities (house, terms [Ptolemaic and Egyptian], triplicity [all rulers44], exaltation/depression), monomoiria, fixed stars near the planets (with step, magnitude, longitude and latitude), the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, lunar nodes and prenatal syzygy.The planets are also described by their step, magnitude, longitude and latitude.In addition to these, the chart also supplies the planetary decan and face, and planetary phase of appearance in relation to the Sun. Table 7 provides an easy-to-see comparison between the technical data of our horoscope and those with which it has been compared in the previous paragraphs.Table 7.Technical Data in Berl. 9825 Compared to Other Elaborate Horoscopes.Types of technical data:tBerl. 9825tOxy. astr. 4277tLond. 1.130tLond. 1.98tEutocius Dignities: housetXtXtXtXtX termtXtXtXtXtX triplicitytXtXtXt tX exaltation/depressiontXtXtXtXtX LatitudetXt t tX (but missing)tX Step & directiontXtXt tX (but missing)tX MagnitudetXt tXt tX MonomoiriatXtXt t tX DodekatemoriontXtXtXtXt Fixed stars (paranatellonta)tXt tXt tX LotstFortune, Daimon, Eros, Necessity, Courage, Victory, NemesistFortune, Daimon, [Eros], NecessitytFortune (?)t?

This exposition will provide possible rationales for including them in the calculation of a horoscope.The data to be discussed are: Dignities Monomoiria Dodekatemoria Presiding and Managing Length of life Pre-natal syzygy Master of the nativity Lots Astrological manuals of the Greco-Roman period and Late Antiquity may supply both methods and reasons for the technical data used by practicing astrologers. Often, they are not used in a vacuum, but can be intertwined with one another to produce an interpretation for specific concerns a client might have, such as happiness, fortune and length of life.For our particular horoscope, doctrines outlined by Paulus Alexandrinus, a fourth-century CE astrologer practicing in Alexandria, frequently coincide with those used in our horoscope. A number of them are given a thorough treatment in Pauluss Introduction to Astrology, produced in 378 CE. The works of other astrologers will also be consulted in elucidating the reasons for using specific techniques.For astrologers, horoscope interpretation necessarily involves a number of factors to be synthesized and applied.The Compendium of Rhetorius (fl. probably 6th century CE)46 provides instructions for applying these.It includes seven considerations for the astrological interpretation of a birthchart, especially in delineating the circumstances at birth, the parents, and fortunate or unfortunate life circumstances. Technical data to be considered include dignities (especially triplicity/trigon lords), the latitude of the Moons winds, the position of the new or full moon prior to birth, lots (especially the Lots of Fortune, Daimon, Basis and Exaltation), and the ascending and descending nodes of the Moon.Another text, attributed by Franz Cumont to a Byzantine compiler who excerpted Rhetorius (Par. gr. 2506, fol. 73 and Ven. 7, fol. 170, in CCAG 8.1: 243-244) tells us to examine the decans or faces...the monomoiriai, the bright degrees, the dodekatemoria, and the latitudes of the winds and the steps; the phases, stations and the co-risings of the fixed stars nearest by degree to them... .47 The same document also recommends looking at the pre-natal conjunction or opposition of Sun and Moon (i.e. new or full Moon). Thus, as outlined by Rhetorius, our papyrus gives data for performing a very complete horoscope analysis.Dignities Dignities are frequently added to extant horoscopes, as well as mentioned in astrological manuals. A definition of each type of dignity used in our horoscope can be found above in the astronomical commentary.Dignities are important in interpretation because they allow assessment of the quality and power of the planet involved. They also allow the astrologer to assess the interaction between planets based on their rulerships and rulers.Each kind of dignity can provide more nuance in evaluation.For example, the term ruler of a luminary was often used as a factor in length of life.But the various rulers u2013 house, exaltation, triplicity, term and decan u2013 could also be used to find an overall chart ruler, or the ruler of a specific topic.48 This discussion will briefly give some of the reasons that dignities are used in astrological interpretation, accompanied by the details of our horoscope. 1. House rulership.This is the most commonly reported dignity, and often mentioned in chart interpretation.The house ruler is essential to the construction of the thema mundi, a symbolic chart for the birthday of the cosmos,49 where each planet falls in one its zodiacal houses.The nativity of any person can be compared to the thema mundi as an example of an ideal chart.50 In our horoscope, the house ruler is missing for the Sun (as all details are) and Moon. All other house rulers are correct. 2.Term rulership.In systems of finding rulers for length of life, the term ruler of a predominating planet can become the primary indicator of longevity.In our horoscope all the term rulers are correct except for Venus, which (using the Egyptian system) should be in the terms of Mars, not Saturn. 3.Triplicity rulership.The triplicity lords, especially of the sect luminaries (i.e., the Sun for a day chart and the Moon for a night chart), are used for different purposes, including assessments for eminence (Valens, Anthology II, 2 and 22 [Pingree 1986]) and for gaining happiness, fortune or property (Dorotheus, Carmen Astrologicum I, 24-26 and Valens II, 2). In our horoscope, triplicity rulers are given for eight positions including the lunar nodes (Sun is missing).For four planets these are correct: Moon, Saturn, Venus and Mercury; incorrect are the triplicity rulers for Jupiter, Mars and both lunar nodes.The errors show a tendency on the part of the charts composer to list the diurnal triplicity rulers for earth and water instead of the nocturnal rulers. 4. Exaltation and Depression.The effect of exaltation is similar to that of house. A planet in its exaltation is fortified for effective action, and can aid planets located in its sign of exaltation.Conversely, a planet in the sign of its depression is weak and ineffective, or even harmful.In our horoscope the exaltations are given for four positions: Saturn, Jupiter, Venus and the descending node (the Moons is missing, and no planets are exalted in the signs of Scorpio and Sagittarius, where Mars, Mercury and the ascending node are located). Depressions are given for Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and the ascending node (there is no exaltation or depression in Sagittarius, where Mercury lies, and in Taurus, where the descending node lies).All exaltations and depressions are accurate.Monomoiriai Our horoscope includes data on monomoiriai by sign.Chapter 5 of Pauluss Introduction explains this doctrine (another form, by trigon/triplicity, is discussed in Chapter 32). This process is dependent on the house-ruler of the sign, and the so-called Chaldean order of the planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon).To find the planetary ruler of the monomoiria (which means u2018single degree) of a signs degree, one starts with the house ruler of that sign, which rules its first degree.Thus, for Aries and Scorpio, Mars is the ruler of the first degree.The process continues with the planets in Chaldean order through the rest of the degrees of Aries and Scorpio u2013 the second degrees ruler is the Sun, the third degrees Venus, and so on. For the Venus-ruled signs of Taurus and Libra, one begins with Venus for the first degrees ruler, Mercury for the second degree, Moon for the third degree, Saturn for the fourth degree, and so on.Paulus provides a table at the end of Chapter 5. A scholion for this chapter51 states that monomoiriai can connect (by sympathy ) two planets otherwise unrelated to each other, since it assigns degrees based on planets ruling signs that may not make a conventional aspect, such as Aries and Scorpio (both ruled by Mars). Valens mentions monomoiriai in his Anthology, IV, 26 (Pingree 1986), which seem to operate under the same set of rules that Paulus gives for the monomoiria by sign.Monomoiriai are also mentioned in Ch. XXXV of the Liber Hermetis52 but these seem to be the monomoiriai by triplicity (also covered in Paulus, Ch. 32).In original documentary horoscopes, the calculation of the monomoiria is rare.We find it calculated for the Midheaven, Lower midheaven, Lot of Fortune and Lot of Daimon in one deluxe horoscope, Oxy. astr. 4277 (Hor. gr. 150-250b).53 In the Eutocius horoscope monomoiriai are calculated for all five planets and the two luminaries, the prenatal full Moon, the Ascendant, Midheaven, Lot of Fortune and Lot of Daimon. In our horoscope, the monomoiriai are all correct except for that of Mercury.Dodekatemoria Dodekatemorion means, simply, u2018twelfth-part.It can be used to refer to any twelfth-part of something u2013 a twelfth-part of the 360u00b0 circle, i.e. one zodiacal sign; a twelfth-part of a sign of 30u00b0, i.e. 2 u00bdu00b0; or any portion of 12 degrees.The concept originates with the Babylonians.54 Paulus discusses the doctrine of dodekatemoria in Chapter 22. The doctrine is known in other authors, such as Julius Firmicus Maternus (Mathesis II, 13.2-3), but Firmicus multiplies the degrees of the sign by 12 and adds that sum to 0u00b0 of the sign to produce the dodekatemorion, while Paulus multiplies by 13, which effectively takes into account the actual degree of the sign in question.The Babylonian system, as Rochberg demonstrates, matches what Paulus does: Given a position in the zodiac (longitude [l]1 expressed in degrees (n) of a zodiacal sign (z), a second position in the zodiac (l2) [i.e. the dodekatemorion] may be obtained by multiplying the degrees n by 12 and adding the result to the first longitude [l1 = nu00b0 of z]: l2 = 12n + nu00b0 of z. 55 As an example, Paulus gives Aries 11u00b0. He multiplies the degrees by 13, yielding 143u00b0.He adds that sum to the beginning of Aries: 143u00b0 + 0u00b0 [Aries 0u00b0] = 143u00b0 = Leo 23u00b0. (Effectively 12n + n + z = 13n + z.) Olympiodorus (Ch. 20; Boer 1962: 41.12-20) uses the example of an Ascendant at Scorpio 20u00b0.Multiplying 20u00b0 by 13 = 260u00b0.Add that to the beginning of Scorpio, i.e. 210u00b0: 260u00b0 + 210u00b0 = 470u00b0. 470 - 360 = 110u00b0, or Cancer 20u00b0. (Olympiodorus explains this differently, but effectively this is what he is doing.) The calculation of dodekatemoria is rare in original documentary horoscopes, as we saw above.56 In our horoscope only the sign of the dodekatemorion is given, not the degrees. The dodekatemoria for the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter (for the corrected position of Virgo 3u00b0 40', not Virgo 7u00b0 40'), Mars and Venus match what the Paulus formula would produce.However, the positions of Mercury, both lunar nodes and the prenatal full Moons dodekatemoria do not match what Pauluss formula would produce (they do match the Firmicus formula which also fits for Saturn, Jupiter [corrected position] and Mars). Two possibilities could explain this result.First, the birthcharts constructor did use the Paulus formula, but neglected to calculate the minutes of each position, at least for Mercury, the nodes and the prenatal full moon (the dodekatemorion for Mercury is Gemini 0u00b0 29', almost in Taurus where the text says it is).Since no degrees are given for the dodekatemoria, only signs, this could have been a further truncation of the entire procedure. Or, the charts constructor could have been using the Firmicus formula, but miscalculated for the Moon and Venus.Paulus tells us that this procedure is important for obtaining information about whether someone will be u2018fortunate, long-lived and blessed (Ch. 22, Boer 1958: 46.15-16) or make them u2018laborers, ... unable to acquire property and cursed(Ch. 22, Boer 1958: 46.21-22); such people will also have short lives, violent deaths, illnesses and injuries (Ch. 22, Boer 1958: 46.23). If the dodekatemorion of a benefic falls in the sign of the natal Sun, Moon, Mercury, cardines, Lots of Fortune, Daimon or Necessity, or on the prenatal lunation, this is said to be fortunate, but when a malefics dodekatemorion falls there, the effects are unfortunate.Presiding and Managing Few authors except for Paulus mention the concept of presiding and managing.The earliest appears to be Serapion, in a text on katarchai.57 Antiochus of Athens58 gives outcomes for those born when certain hour rulers manage during a day, usually based on whether the planetary ruler is a benefic or malefic. Another text, by Zenarion (about whom nothing further is known) also uses the technique in katarchic charts.59 In Chapter 21, On the Star Presiding and the One Managing Paulus outlines the technique and promotes its use both in nativities and katarchai.He further approves its use in decumbitures, a chart cast for when an ill person takes to his or her bed.Pauluss method depends, first, on finding the god ruling over the day in question (Ch. 20, u2018On Knowing to which of the Gods Each Day Belongs). This is the god traditionally assigned to each day of the week.Thus, if the day in question is a Sunday, the Sun is the god of the day.Once the god (i.e. planet) of the day is known, that planet presides over the entire 24-hour day, which is sectioned into 12 day and 12 night hours.60 The presiding planet rules the 1st, 8th, 15th and 22nd hours of that day.The hour rulers are assigned in the so-called Chaldean order from the presiding planet, and become the u2018managers of that hour, beginning with the first hour of the day. Olympiodorus, Pauluss commentator, covers the same material (Ch. 18).As an example, the well-known katarchic horoscope for the crowning of Leontius at Antioch (Hor. gr. 484.VII.18 = GH L484), lists Mercury as u03c0u03bfu03bbu03b5u03c5u0301u03c9u03bd and u03b4u03b9u03b5u0301u03c0u03c9u03bd, and uses this as the reason the chart was not successful: but they [the astrologers] did not pay attention, first, that the presiding and managing [planet], Mercury, had fallen into misfortune (u03b5u1f30u03c2 u03c0u03b1u0301u03b8u03bfu03c2). For it was at its greatest [distance] from the Sun, which brings about violent death, and it was aspected only by Saturn. 61 Only three other extant horoscopes include this technique: all are from literary sources, with dates in the fifth century CE (Hor. gr. 475.VII.16 = GH L475, Hor. gr. 479.VII.14 = GH L479, and 487.IX.5 = GH L487, the last of which mentions only the managing ruler).In our horoscope, the planets presiding and managing are listed as Jupiter and Saturn. These would be correct if this was a diurnal chart for the 7th hour of the day of 319 CE, November 19, but this horoscope is nocturnal and belongs to the night preceding the day of November 19.62 In the system outlined by Paulus, and also mentioned by Vettius Valens, an anonymous Christian writer on the hours of the day of the week, and Cassius Dio,63 the 24-hour day begins at sunrise with the planetary day hours. This is the usual epoch for this system, probably arising from the fact that the Hellenistic Egyptians began the day at sunrise.But other epochs were also in use, in which the 24-hour day could begin at sunset.64 Neugebauer and Van Hoesen mention horoscopes in the fourth century that use an evening epoch, and a calendar of 354 CE does as well.65 So it seems that the author of our horoscope was using an evening epoch with the Alexandrian calendar, where the day begins at sunset, and begins it by applying the usual rulers of the day hours to this evening epoch. Even though it was still Wednesday, November 18, in a day epoch (where the presiding planet would be Mercury and the managing planet, Mars, rules the 7th hour), in an evening epoch the presiding planet would be Jupiter (the presiding planet for Thursday November 19, 319), and the planet managing the 7th hour is Saturn.Because the beginning of the text is lost, we cannot know for certain how the author dated it. But this explanation seems plausible based on our knowledge of the use of epochs in this timeframe.Though it does contradict the common practice of planetary days and hours outlined by Paulus, the author was not necessarily incorrect in using the day rulers for an evening epoch, even if he was unorthodox.Length of Life: Master of the Nativity and the Prenatal Syzygy Although we have no way of knowing how the author of our chart planned to use the calculated information, discovering length of life is an important consideration addressed by ancient astrologers. Aside from the use of term rulers, two of the techniques used to determine this are included in our chart: the housemaster/master of the nativity, and the prenatal syzygy.Master of the Nativity This is yet another technique mentioned by Paulus in his Introduction.Chapter 36, On Housemastership (u03a0u03b5u03c1u1f76 u03bfu03b9u0313u03bau03bfu03b4u03b5u03c3u03c0u03bfu03c4u03b5u03b9u0301u03b1u03c2), provides the conditions under which a planet may become the chart ruler (or, to use Pauluss term, the u03bau03c5u0301u03c1u03b9u03b1 u03c4u1fc6u03c2 u03b3u03b5u03bdu03b5u0301u03c3u03b5u03c9u03c2, authority of the nativity). The Sun and Moon are most important in this process, the Sun being used in a day chart, but the Moon at night.In a nocturnal chart, as ours is, one looks at the term-ruler and house-steward (u03bfu03b9u0313u03bau03bfu03b4u03b5u0301u03bau03c4u03c9u03c1) of the Moon, and then at whether the Sun or Moon (depending on the sect of the chart) are in u2018effective places.At night, the effective places are the four cardines, the fifth (Good Fortune), eleventh (Good Daimon), second and eighth. Let us apply these rules to our papyrus.In a nocturnal nativity, we look at the Moon.We know that the Ascendant is Virgo 10u00b0 57', and that the Moon is likely to fall between 24u00b0 (roughly its mean position) and 27u00b0 Cancer.Using the whole-sign place system, the Moon will fall in the 11th place, that of the Good Daimon, which is an effective place.The term-ruler for the Moon at 26u00b0 Cancer is still Jupiter, but in the next degree moves to Saturn in the Egyptian system. That the horoscope gives Jupiter as the u2018master of the nativity would therefore suggest a position of around 26u00b0 for the Moon (as also suggested in Part I of this commentary).The house-steward of the Moon in Cancer is, of course, the Moon.Jupiter is also in an effective place, the first (including the entire sign of Virgo as the first place).So far it seems that the Moon and Jupiter have equal claim on rulership. Then Paulus says when one star has more counts than the others and is found at morning rising [in a phase of visibility] on a cardine and in its own throne, this one has the rulership, especially if it oversees (u03bau03b1u03c4u03bfu03c0u03c4u03b5u03c5u0301u03c9) the sect luminary. 66 Jupiter has no counts of rulership in the early degrees of Virgo (in fact, its depression is Virgo).It sextiles the Moon, the sect luminary, by sign (but in fact, by degree makes no aspect). (It also sextiles the other luminary, the Sun, by sign.) It is in a phase of visibility, and would appear in the eastern sky before the sun rises. It is also in a cardine, the Ascendant/first place.By contrast, the Moon is in its own house and face, which would give it two counts to Jupiters zero.It is not on a cardine, but it is the sect luminary.This would seem to give the Moon an edge over Jupiter.Further, since both Jupiter and the Moon are in effective places, and Paulus says that if a luminary is in an effective place it becomes the ruler, it would seem that the Moon should have been chosen. However, it may be that the astrologer has (incorrectly) moved to Pauluss next condition: examining the term-ruler, triplicity lord or house-steward of the prenatal Full Moon (for a nocturnal birth).The Prenatal Syzygy The preceding full Moon took place at Taurus 20u00b0 30'.This is the house of Venus, the term of Jupiter and the triplicity of the Moon.This position falls, however, in the ninth place, not usually considered an effective place (although it is a good decline and the place of the Sun god).67 If the prenatal full Moon is not in an effective place, Paulus says, one must look at the triplicity, house and term rulers of the Lots of Fortune or Daimon; and also the lord of the Ascendant. The Lot of Fortune falls in the 10th degree of Capricorn: triplicity of the Moon, house of Saturn and term of Jupiter.The Lot of Daimon falls in the 13th degree of Taurus: triplicity of the Moon, house of Venus, term of Mercury.The lord of the Ascendant is Mercury.We know that the Moon and Jupiter are in effective places; Saturn is in the eighth (effective), Venus in the second (also effective) and Mercury in the fourth (effective). u2018And if the one ruling these places is found being aspected in the aforegiven places with that one which it has received, it will be taken as the authority of the nativity.68 In our chart, the Moon opposes Fortune by sign, Saturn squares it and Jupiter trines it. The Moon sextiles Daimon by sign, makes no aspect to Venus (but both are in Venus-ruled signs) and no aspect to Mercury.Mercury squares the Ascendant.There seems to be no clear winner here.Jupiter is not particularly dominant; it is only the term ruler of the Lot of Fortune.Although it is in an effective place and trines Fortune, this rationale seems weak for giving it the rulership instead of the Moon. For Venus sharing the rulership, there are the following considerations.Venus is in its own house.It is in a phase of visibility (rising before the sun and not combust).It is in an effective place (the 2nd) in a nocturnal horoscope, according to Paulus.However, it is still something of a mystery as to why the astrologer chose Jupiter as the master of the nativity, unless the fact that it was well placed in the Ascendant, well ahead of the sun and in a phase of visibility, is the term ruler of the prenatal full Moon and aspects both the luminaries and the Lot of Fortune, gives it more advantages than the equally well-placed and more dignified Moon. Lots Lots have an oversized presence in our horoscope: seven lots are prominently featured.Our horoscope is the earliest, and only original documentary, chart to contain so many lots.69 Using the formulae of Paulus, they are calculated by degree and minute, and supplied with both their house and term ruler.More exclusively, then, than the other techniques supplied in this horoscope, these lots are directly associated with Paulus Alexandrinus. Besides his later commentator Olympiodorus, he is the only author in the extant corpus to provide formulae for these lots.His chapter on lots mentions each by name, with its formula, and associates it with a planet: Suitably, the lots have this origin: since by nature the Moon is set down as Fortune, the Sun Daimon, Aphrodite Eros, the [star] of Hermes Necessity, that of Ares Courage, that of Zeus Victory, and that of Kronos Nemesis. 70 This order matches the listing of the lots in our horoscope. Pauluss commentator, Olympiodorus (writing in 564 CE),71 spells out the direct connection of each lot to a celestial body: ...7 lots owing to the number of the 7 stars. 72 At present this is the only documentary horoscope to contain all of the planetary lots that Paulus describes, using the formulae he provides.In literary horoscopes, one rather corrupt text associated with Olympiodorus likely calculates the Lot of Eros according to Pauluss formula.73 No other documentary or literary horoscope up to the end of Late Antiquity uses any of Pauluss lot formulae for the Lots of Eros, Necessity, Courage, Victory or Nemesis. In the Arabic period, a horoscope transmitted by Abu016b Mau2018shar includes the Lots of Courage and Victory, and a lot called Intellect and Native Wit, the formula of which is identical to the Paulus formula for the Lot of Necessity.74 Finally, a nativity calculated for September 3, 905 CE, calculates, among others, the Lots of Fortune, Daimon and Eros.75 But the calculation for the Lot of Eros does not use Pauluss formula.76 The Planetary Lots in Context Prior to the discovery of this horoscope, only one literary and no documentary horoscopes contained the Lots of Eros and/or Necessity using Pauluss formulae, and none before the end of Late Antiquity contained the Lots of Courage, Victory or Nemesis. Our horoscope is unique within the extant corpus in containing all seven lots as described, with formulae and meanings, by Paulus.Before Paulus, who was writing in 378 CE,77 the Lots of Fortune and (less so) Daimon appear somewhat regularly in documentary and literary horoscopes, as well as (albeit rarely) the Lots of Eros and Necessity.78 Vettius Valens and Firmicus Maternus are the main authors who discuss interpretation and provide formulae for these four lots. However, the formulae they use for the Lots of Eros and Necessity are not those that Paulus specifies in his astrological treatise.79 Thus, before the fourth century CE, no documentary evidence exists for use of the Paulus formulae, and no calculation of the Lots of Courage, Victory or Nemesis.In astrological texts said to antedate Paulus, only Antiochus of Athens provides a short section on these lots (see below). Previous work on lots has posited two traditions of calculation for the lots of Eros and Necessity.80 One tradition may be designated Hermetic, after the assertion by Olympiodorus and a scholiast for Paulus that these lots derive from a book by Hermes Trismegistus called the Panaretos.81 The other tradition is called Egyptian, drawing on a scholion to a passage in Hephaestios Apotelesmatika III, 6.11, describing two methods for casting the Lots of Necessity and Eros according to Hermes Trismegistus or, just as in the 4th book, Dorotheus gives an account of the opinion of the Egyptians. 82 This scholion thus supplies evidence of two lot traditions for these lots in antiquity. One of Pauluss passages on the planetary lots has a number of similarities to a passage that the later compiler Rhetorius claims are from the Thesaurus of Antiochus of Athens, whose probable floruit was the second century CE.Antiochus associates a planet or luminary with each lot, but gives no formula to calculate them, or an origin (we can assume they are the same lots Paulus describes because of the similar wording).83 Possibly Paulus and Antiochus drew on a similar source, or Paulus was the first to come across this passage by Antiochus, because no other author in the extant literature before 378 CE mentions such lots. In the second century, Vettius Valens specifically associates the Lots of Fortune, Daimon, Eros and Necessity with several astrological techniques (e.g.Anthology II 37, IV 4-10, 25 [Pingree 1986]), but does not use the Paulus formulae and does not mention any other planetary lots.Pauluss near contemporary, Firmicus Maternus, mentions a Lot of Nemesis along with his versions of the Lots of Eros and Necessity (Mathesis, VI.32), but his formulae for them also do not match Pauluss. It should be emphasized that Paulus himself does not mention Hermes as the originator of these lots, nor does the word Panaretos appear anywhere in his text, but only in the title of Chapter 23.The word panaretos means all-virtuous.In the extant corpus of Greek works, its association to a book, as in the phrase u03c0u03b1u03bdu03b1u03c1u03b5u0301u03c4u03bfu03c2 u03b2u03b9u0301u03b2u03bbu03bfu03c2 (or variants) is rare.Panaretos does not appear in reference to a book until the fourth century CE. The phrase u03c0u03b1u03bdu03b1u03c1u03adu03c4u1ff3 u03b2u03afu03b2u03bbu1ff3 appears in Pap.Mag.Leid. J 395 (PGM XIII.981-982) where it is associated with Ptolemaica. 84 Its association with Hermes Trismegistus appears only in the Paulus-connected texts.Other uses of the word Panaretos appear to be restricted to later ecclesiastical writings (there is mention in the fourth century of a Panaretos on the wisdom of Solomon).85 It does not seem to have anything to do with the astrological Panaretos. It is difficult to judge the date of the Panaretos.No extant texts earlier than the fourth century mention it.One could assume, as the Gundels did, that any Hermetic text would likely have been written around the 2nd century BCE.86 But that any mention of the Panaretos does not arise until the fourth century suggests that the text was unknown before then.It may have been discovered during that time. In addition, Paulus does not mention Hermes Trismegistus as the author.Perhaps Olympiodorus attached the name of Hermes to the text to give it authenticity, or the text did have the name of Hermes attached to it (but this was not noted until the Olympiodorus commentary).In any case, Berl. 9825, containing the chart of a birth in 319, fits into this fourth-century timeframe.Because of the uncertainty surrounding the origins of these lots, it is testamentary evidence of the work of Paulus Alexandrinus, as well as an exclusive and important witness to the use of all the planetary lots in practice. Conclusions This horoscope undoubtedly ranks among the most comprehensive of antiquity.The amount of technical data it includes puts it near, if not at the top, of elaborate horoscopes of antiquity.It is significant both astronomically and astrologically.Astrologically, it is an astounding example of the variety of technical data and methods used by astrologers in late antiquity.As this astrological commentary has shown, a number of the techniques included in our horoscopes data have been covered by Paulus Alexandrinus in his Introduction. Among his specialties, dodekatemoria, monomoiriai, presiding and managing planets and, especially, planetary lots, whose formulae Paulus is the first to delineate, appear in our papyrus.While it is highly unlikely that a definitive author of this horoscope will ever be known, these connections to Paulus and his work provoke some further attention.The timeframe of 319 easily falls within Pauluss lifetime (he wrote the Introduction in 378 CE). That the horoscope was cast for the latitude of Syene, in Upper Egypt, suggests an Egyptian link, and Paulus was known to have practiced astrology in Alexandria. A compelling piece of evidence is, of course, the seven planetary lots calculated with the formulae described first by Paulus (and, during Late Antiquity, later taken up only by his commentator Olympiodorus).It is possible, then, that the horoscope was calculated by someone following the practices of Paulus as a student, perhaps practicing the calculation of multiple techniques as a student exercise.87 Equally, we have no way of knowing whose chart was calculated. It includes mainly coins found in the regions that were part of imperial Rome's African provinces, with some material from Western Europe for comparative purposes.This database represents data culled from numerous sources and previous publications, representing one of the largest single collections of numismatic material from Roman Africa during this period currently available; though it is by no means exhaustive, and further research is needed to supplement the present project. I present here an overview and some notes on the quantification of this material, highlighting the most prominent and interesting patterns. This quantification suggests certain interpretations concerning key topics in the monetary history of the western Empire, which I point to briefly.Further, the complete dataset is provided for download as both a csv file and a more structured data file (JSON file) to facilitate future research on Roman Africa's numismatic record as well as related information.My intention is, thus, both to advance the study of Africa's numismatic heritage in general as well as to contribute to the available corpus of accessible, digital information concerning the ancient world. n nLibrary of Congress Subjects: Numismatics, Roman; Economic History--to 500. n nContents n nIntroduction n nConstructing the Database of African Coins n nPrevious scholarship on the numismatics record of Roman Africa n nThe Data: Quantitative Overview n nWhat Does Africa's Numismatic Record Reveal About Rome's Monetary System? n nConclusion n nAppendix: Sources of Numismatic Data n nAppendix: Links to Downloadable Data n nNotes n nBibliography n nIntroduction n nThis article presents a summary, overview, and quantification of a large sample of numismatic material from Roman Africa u2014 modern day Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya u2014 during the high imperial period. This includes any type of coin found in the region, whether in a hoard, through an archaeological excavation, or as a stray find, minted anywhere in the Roman world (though the vast majority were minted at Rome) between the years 23 BCE and 275 CE.Africa is one of the richest regions of the Roman Empire in terms of its archaeological heritage, including of course coinage.My purpose in writing this article and offering the database in digital format are twofold: firstly, no systematic summary or overview of the coinage from Roman African currently exists, despite the region being one of the largest and most prosperous areas of the Empire and having been subject to many years of study by some of the world's leading numismatists. The overview, elucidation, and interpretation of the material offered here is meant to contribute to the study of Roman numismatics generally as well Roman economic history and the history of North Africa.My second goal is to supply a digital record of the complete database on which this overview is based in a structured, accessible, stable, and reusable way. n nA crucial part of making this material useful for other scholars is providing ready access to the data. An open digital publication ISAW Papers, provides the most suitable venue for such an effort.Admittedly, offering the complete dataset for public consumption in this way is perhaps a bit unusual for a scholarly article dealing with ancient material evidence.Scholars in Classics and the Humanities generally, however, are coming more and more to appreciate the opportunities afforded by digital technologies for enhancing and aiding academic research. In particular, digital datasets and a linked data approach are being increasingly utilized not merely as a means of presenting an argument, but as an indispensible tool in the gathering, organization, and interpretation of evidence.1 In order to reap the full rewards of this 'digital revolution', though, it is essential for scholars to share their data in an open, accessible, and structured way.The database appended to this article will, I hope, contribute in a small way to this overall project. n nIn the next section, I explain how the database was constructed and what is, and is not, included. I then provide a brief, general discussion of previous scholarship on coinage from Roman Africa, outlining some of the problems one encounters trying to gather together evidence from scattered sources. I next provide a quantitative analysis of the numismatic material. This allows me to point out the most salient patterns and peculiarities displayed by the material, concentrating on the material from Africa itself, but bringing in evidence from other regions by way of providing context to explain the African data.Then, I offer some interpretations about these patterns. I explore how this material can elucidate the Roman monetary system and the production, distribution, and use of both small and large denomination coins. Essentially, I argue that Roman Africa featured a robust monetized economy reflected in the numismatic record from the region.More importantly, I suggest further that the broader economic, political, and military history of the region suggests that coinage was coming into the area primarily for the use of the region u2019s inhabitants, as opposed to being principally the result of spending by the state.2 Finally, I conclude by summarizing the key points brought up in the earlier sections before ending the article pointing out the benefits and, indeed, importance of providing access to the complete dataset in a digital publication such as ISAW Papers. n nConstructing the Database of African Coins n nIn all, the database consists of 50,970 coins plus associated information, including each coin's denomination, its metal, find-spot, mint date, weight (where that information was available), and find context (namely, whether it came from a secure hoard or as a stray find, as from an archaeological excavation). It also includes the name of the Roman province corresponding to the modern-day find spot for coins found in North Africa (though, for simplicity's sake, not for coins found in Europe).These coins were all minted by Roman authorities, mainly the legitimate rulers of the Roman state but including also coins minted by rival claimants to legitimate power such as the rulers of the so-called Gallic Empire. I have not included coins which have been positively identified as ancient imitations, although this is an interesting topic which deserves some treatment.3 The majority of the coins come from the territory of Roman Africa (35,559), but I include also a smaller number of coins from Europe: the Gallic provinces (13,587), and small numbers from Spain (1,207) and Britain (617).4 The non-African material is included for comparison and to provide some context for discussion of the patterns revealed by simple analyses of the African evidence. In compiling this database, I chose to focus on coins minted before 275 CE, the date of Aurelian u2019s defeat of the last rulers of the breakaway Gallic Empire.Aurelian u2019s victory was followed by a reunification of the territory in the northwestern Empire as well as the beginnings of a radical overhaul of Rome u2019s monetary policy, culminating in Diocletian u2019s reign at the beginning of the fourth century. Certainly the events of the fourth and fifth centuries CE are very interesting in their own right and many of the developments of Late Antiquity have their origins in the events of the third century.It is, though, beyond the scope of this work to investigate this later period. n nThe African material in the database is the result of a detailed survey of the available records (I list sources of this information in the Appendix). This work was conducted primarily at the American Numismatic Society, supplemented with a stint at the Cabinet des M u00e9dailles in the Biblioth u00e8que nationale de France in Paris; two of the largest collections of numismatic resources in the world.My primary goal was to survey the numismatic record from Roman Africa in support of broader arguments about the Roman economy.The resulting database has supported analyses presented in several publications.5 I offer the full database here in order to facilitate continued investigation into Roman Africa's rich numismatic record, saving scholars from having to reduplicate such labor-intensive effort in the future. My hope is that the database will continue to grow, as scholars with access to records I was not able to find supplement the database, or as new discoveries are made and added to the list; the more that we present the fruits of our labour to the scholarly community through open, digital publication of data, the more we all benefit from the collective effort. n nIn building the database, I relied on the excellent tradition of numismatic research concerning Roman Africa. Although no single collection of coins found in the region has previously been attempted, there has been a great deal of work in the past on particular finds or on sites that have produced coins.Many impressive numismatic studies have been produced in recent decades by local Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, and Libyan scholars as well as by European numismatists.The majority of Roman coins that have been uncovered in North Africa, however, were discovered and published in the nineteenth or early twentieth centuries, largely by French scholars working in what was at the time French colonial territory in Tunisia and Algeria. Unfortunately, the publication of this material is not as complete or detailed as desired, or as informative as would be demanded of a modern scholar.This issue, in fact, plagues work on the ancient world generally.The importance of this is that many of the Roman coins discovered in Africa before about the 1970s are recorded without a full, detailed catalogue and feature only cursory information about denomination, type, find-spot, mint location, and minting date. n nAnother, related issue is that many of the coins discovered in the region before the middle of the twentieth century have dispersed, sometimes with no clear record of where the coins actually ended up, or at least have become unavailable for scholarly study for a variety of reasons. Much ancient material, including Roman-era coinage, was allowed to leave the region, some of which ended up in museum holdings, but which mostly ended up in the hands of private owners.The result of all this is the frustrating situation that many finds of Roman-era coinage are known as they are mentioned in various archaeological reports from the region, but they are described in only vague terms often without detail even on the exact number of coins which were found, making it very difficult to perform any usable analysis on the material. n nAs it stands, the database offered here represents the most comprehensive single collection of numismatic data concerning coins found in Roman Africa published to date. It is, however, by no means an exhaustive or completely comprehensive set of Africa's numismatic record.There are certainly gaps, as I was not able to access all published material, due to records being lost, or simply a lack of the resources needed to track down rare material in far-flung collections.This is particularly problematic with coins found in excavations, as certain excavation reports I have simply not been able to track down, while other excavation reports (particularly those conducted prior to the 1970s) do not provide sufficient details on the coins found. The database I provide here, therefore, should be considered provisional and always a work-in-progress; I will consider this project a success only if work continues on this important topic and the database is supplemented in the future. n nThe only resource that provides detailed information about individual coins are lists of specific hoards or archaeological reports cataloging the numismatic finds. These resources are invaluable to any attempt at reaching generalizations or interregional analysis, yet it is extremely difficult and time-consuming to track down all of the information scattered across so many different publications held in libraries across the globe and written in several different languages.This is why I am eager to provide the complete database that I was able to assemble over the course of years of research; my primary intention is to free up future scholars from having to repeat these efforts, allowing them instead to concentrate on combining this material with other evidence and analyzing the data to reach novel conclusions. n nFurther, I am only concerned here with Roman coins produced between 23 BCE and 275 CE. There was a rich numismatic tradition in the region during the Punic period as well as with the Numidian kingdoms before the reorganization of the region into Roman provinces under Augustus as well as into the later antique period after Diocletian's reforms; each of these developments deserves its own study, so I do not treat that material here.6 Within these limits, this article and the appended database represents an attempt to present in straightforward and systematic fashion a synthetic overview of available numismatic evidence through quantitative survey and to provide complete, open access to the data. n nSuch synthetic analysis is, unfortunately, somewhat rare in ancient numismatic scholarship, not including general typological surveys such as the Roman Provincial Coinage volumes.7 There are several very informative and learned general studies of Roman numismatics, but these do not provide comprehensive detail about the material being analyzed.8 Pierre Salama, one of the most prolific scholars working on the numismatic history of North Africa, has in recent years attempted to provide something like an overview of Roman coin-finds from the region.9 These articles provide a list of all known finds of Roman coinage in the region, concentrating on the hoard finds. These are invaluable and much needed works, although Salama is not interested in providing a detailed synthesis of the information provided by the numismatic material.Similarly, Georges Depeyrot in 2011 posted online an unpublished article10 containing the provisional findings of a project on the monetary history of North Africa begun in 2010 which, in his words, u201c u00e9tait de faire conna u00eetre et d' u00e9tudier les d u00e9couvertes mon u00e9taires dans cette region [was meant to make a report and study of the coin finds from that region]. u201d The impetus for the project was, clearly, his observation that no systematic treatment of the African material had been completed and his hope that future researchers will pick up where he left off and see the project to completion. The work presented here takes up this challenge. n nPrevious scholarship on the numismatics record of Roman Africa n nRoman Africa is a large and diverse region.At its core was the province of Africa Proconsularis , centered on modern-day Tunisia (and the ancient capital of Carthage, roughly modern Tunis) and including parts of what today is Algeria and Libya.The region enjoyed a relatively high degree of productivity and stability, even during the later half of the third century CE when the rest of the western Empire was experiencing a wave of crises (I explain this more below).11 Proconsularis in particular is considered one of the wealthiest regions of the Empire, and was certainly one of the most highly urbanized and economically productive. Though the other provinces u2014Numidia, Mauretania Caesariensis, Mauretania Tingitana u2014were also fairly productive. n nThe conditions and causes of economic expansion in the early years of the Empire have been dealt with at length in previous works,12 and I will not rehash these arguments here.Suffice it to note that Africa, and especially parts of Proconsularis and Numidia, featured extremely productive agricultural land. Integration into the imperial economy allowed wealthy landowners in the region to take advantage of markets for agricultural produce in Rome, as well as other parts of Italy, Carthage, and elsewhere.Favorable institutions allowed these wealthy Romans to accumulate large tracts of land, taking advantage of scale factors in expanding production of agricultural produce and manufactures, and provided less well-off property owners and tenant farmers the opportunities to contribute to the regional economy as well. Through the first two centuries CE, Africa experienced an economic boom.This boom was built largely on the production and distribution of wheat and olive oil, two of the Roman world's most important and sought-after consumer goods.Countless studies have exposed the archaeological remains of this productivity: showing ceramic material involved in hauling oil,13 uncovering the processing facilities used to press the olives as well as thrash wheat and produce other goods (fish-sauce, clothing dyes, and other items),14 and revealing improvements made to the region's port facilities to aid in the transport and distribution of these goods.15 All of this productive capacity grew on the back of investments made into the region's infrastructure, providing the impetus for a great deal of urban growth Proconsularis and Numidia especially. n nUnfortunately, despite the great tradition of scholarship into the African economy and specifically on the region's material remains, little attention has been paid to the numismatic record. Yet, I would argue that coins hold great promise in elucidating how the African economy functioned, much the same as studies of the region's ceramic material have revealed so much about the importance of olive oil in the region's economic boom.Exactly what types of coins were circulating in the region at different times?How many coins were there, and what does that tell us about the regions' economic functioning? How were these coins being used?Do the numismatics accord with the indications from other material, such as ceramics, epigraphic evidence, or even the literary record?Are there significant differences between the different African provinces in terms of coin use and availability?How does the African experience compare with other parts of the western Empire?Does the numismatic evidence help to explain larger economic dynamics in the western Empire over the course of the imperial period? n nAll of these questions are critical to advance our understanding of the region and of the Roman economy generally. Answering them requires bringing together and cataloguing that as many of the imperial Roman coins found in Africa as possible, so that future scholars working on a variety of inter-related issues can assess patterns and reach reasonable conclusions based on the empirical record.This article, and the accompanying database, is an attempt at starting such a dialogue. n nThe Data: Quantitative Overview n nFor each coin included in the database, I recorded information concerning the find-spot where the coin was discovered including the corresponding Roman province (for the African material only), the context of the find (hoard or site find), the denomination of the coin, the weight, date and place it was minted, and an estimate of how long the coin spent in circulation when it came from a hoard.16 Not every coin was able to provide data for all categories, but all of the information that I was able to capture is provided in the database appended to this article. Moreover, there is sufficient data here to support quantitative analysis and some interesting insights about the monetary history of North Africa in the first three centuries CE.In this section, I provide a fairly detailed overview of the data, highlighting the most significant patterns that emerge from a quantification of the full body of numismatic material from the region. I focus on four categories for this quantitative analysis: denominational, regional, chronological, and contextual patterns. n na) Denominational Patterns n nI was able to capture information on 33,514 coins minted in the high imperial period which were discovered somewhere in North Africa; 32,357 from various hoards and 1,157 from archaeological stray or site finds (including the 'main' imperial denominations and exclude clear imitations). A breakdown of the number of coins by denomination and type of find is presented in Table 1. As can be seen, the majority (20,037; 60%) of the coins found are antoniniani, an important and interesting feature that I discuss in detail below.Bronze sestertii make up the next-largest denomination group (8,214; 25%), followed by the silver denarius (4,738; 14%) and then lower denomination bronze fractional coinage, including the as, dupondius, quadrans, and small unidentified bronze coins recovered from excavations at about 1.45%, along with a handful (39; <1%) of the highest value currency of the era, the gold aureus. n nDenomination Hoard Site Find Total % of Total antoninianus 19665 372 20037 60 as 4 215 219 1 aureus 38 1 39 <1 denarius 4603 135 4738 14 dupondius 1 69 70 <1 dupondius/as 1 u00f8 1 <1 quadrans 1 10 10 <1 sestertius 8045 169 8214 25 unidentifiable bronze u00f8 186 186 <1 Total 32357 1157 33514 n nThe antoninianus was a substantially overvalued billon coinage first introduced by Caracalla, then briefly abandoned before being reintroduced probably in 235 CE.17 The coinage seems to have been tariffed at 2 denarii,18 although the coin u2019s intrinsic, metallic value was significantly less, since it contained initially only about 1.5 times the amount of silver as was in the denarius. After its reintroduction, the antoninianus quickly became the most frequently appearing coinage in finds from the mid- and late-third century throughout the western Empire. I will come back to this point in the interpretation section, but for now it is useful to separate the antoniniani found in Africa from the other coins.For, the 230s CE represent a transitional time between the stable, tri-metallic monetary system (namely, coins minted in gold, silver, and bronze) in effect for most of the imperial period and the reformed coinage of the late third century CE. n nNot including antoniniani, there are 13,477 imperial coins known from North Africa from the period under consideration here. This can be elucidated further: if only coins minted before 235 CE are included, this leaves 7,985 coins (Table 2).All but 15 of these coins come from the mint at Rome.19 235 CE is chosen as this is the likely date that antoniniani were reintroduced and certainly when they begin to appear in great numbers.The extremely high numbers of antoniniani which were minted between roughly 235 and 275 CE altered the landscape of imperial coinage, although other denominations were still being minted until Aurelian u2019s and Diocletian u2019s reforms. It is also worth pointing out here that less than 8,000 coins found in hoards or as site finds is not a very large quantity from a study area that includes the entire region of North Africa, comprising four Roman provinces, and covers a period of 249 years, 23 BCE to 235 CE.It is notable that roughly the same number of coins from Gaul during this same period are included in the database, although as I discuss here I did not make as exhaustive a survey of the Gallic material as with the African, meaning that it is likely that Gaul actually has left significantly more coins than this in the archaeological record. n nDenomination Hoard Site Find Total % of Total antoninianus 12 10 22 <1 as 4 208 212 3 aureus 38 1 39 <1 denarius 3428 134 3562 45 dupondius 1 69 70 <1 dupondius/as 1 u00f8 1 <1 quadrans u00f8 10 10 <1 sestertius 3753 134 3887 49 unidentifiable bronze u00f8 182 182 2 Total 7237 748 7985 n nSomewhat ironically, North Africa's stability and prosperity during the imperial period may actually be one of the primary reasons that it has left relatively few coins compared to other regions. This is because coins are available to be studied by modern scholars when the coin is lost or buried in antiquity and never recovered.Coins certainly do represent a snap-shot of the monetary economy of the area in which they are recovered, but it is a somewhat skewed picture.Coins left unrecovered u2014in the ground, waiting to be found and studied u2014tend to either be of very low quality/value (essentially 'discarded' or lost), or hoards of coins buried together and, for a variety of reasons, never dug up again. The chief reason that ancient hoards went un-collected is that the people who buried it moved away or died before they had a chance to recover the material, spend it, move it, or melt it down for its metal; and the most common cause of this in antiquity was warfare.In other words, the number of coins found in a given region, especially those found in hoards, can be a strong positive proxy for the level of military and political turmoil in that region.20 n nThis is not to say that hoarding itself was driven solely by warfare, that people would bury coins out of fear of invading troops. Rather, warfare resulted in the death or dislocation of large numbers of people u2014people who had buried coins and, thus, were not able to recover them.Ancient warfare is a key element in the modern-day recovery of coins from antiquity, because in other cases stored coins tended to be recovered or found by someone else, re-used, worn-down, and, eventually, melted down to recuperate the metal the coin contained u2014meaning, critically, that the coins are not available to be found and studied in modern times. This is a particularly salient point when considering the numismatic record from North Africa, for the region remained remarkably stable in terms of military conflict, political instability, disease, and other markers of turmoil compared to northwestern Europe throughout the imperial period and even into the chaotic third century CE.21 The relative paucity of numismatic material from Africa during this period, then, may be in part a product of this relative freedom from warfare, rather than an indication of a poorly-functioning monetary economy. Moreover, the relative economic stability enjoyed by the region would have contributed to this pattern for similar reasons, for a stable monetary economy means that coins retain their value for longer periods, so that they are less 'expendable' and so do not become stray finds and so hoards containing those coins remain 'worth recovering'. I treat the important topic of recoverability in more detail below. n nConcerning the evidence that we do have, as is immediately apparent from Table 2, of coins minted before 235 CE, the denarius and sestertius are by far the most frequently occurring in the evidence, representing 45% and 49% of the total, respectively. It is expected that these would be the two most frequently found denominations, as these were two of the staples of the imperial monetary system.What is curious is that they were found in nearly the same quantity: 3,562 denarii (3,428 from hoards; 134 from site finds) and 3,887 sestertii (3,753 from hoards; 134 from site finds).Traditionally, it has been often assumed that the highest value coins available are hoarded together, whereas site finds tend to be the lowest value coins. It is notable, therefore, that there are not significantly more high-value silver denarii hoarded than lower-value bronze sestertii,22 nor substantially more sestertii than denarii recovered as site finds.More expected is that asses and dupondii were mostly found as site finds, and only a handful of these very low value bronze coins were found in hoards, while aurei exhibit the opposite pattern. n nDenomination Hoard Site Find Total % of Total antoninianus 19653 362 20015 78 as u00f8 8 8 <1 denarius 1175 1 1176 5 sestertius 4292 35 4327 17 unidentifiable bronze u00f8 4 4 <1 Total 25120 410 25530 n nDenomination Hoard Site Find Total % of Total as u00f8 8 8 <1 denarius 1175 1 1176 21 sestertius 4292 35 4327 78 unidentifiable bronze u00f8 4 4 <1 Total 5467 48 5515 n nThe fact that denarii and sestertii minted before 235 CE appear in Africa in roughly equal numbers, then, is a significant finding and deserves some more attention (Table 3). Interestingly, when only the coins minted after 235 CE are considered (Table 3a), there are 4,327 sestertii, the most represented coin in this period after antoniniani.When the antononinianus is not included (Table 3b), this represents a surprising 78% of the 5,515 total.Denarii, in turn, account for only 1,176 (4%) of all African coins minted between 236-275 CE (Table 3a), 21% without antoniniani (Table 3b). n nTaking a larger snapshot and looking at the entire period 23 BCE to 275 CE (Table 4), 13,478 coins are known from Africa, not including antoniniani. Of these, 8,214 or 61% are sestertii (8,045 hoards; 169 site finds), 4,738 or 35% are denarii (4,603 from hoards; 135 site finds), 39 are aurei, and the rest are fractional bronzes.This demonstrates that sestertii from all periods represent a greater percentage of the non-antoninianus total than sestertii minted pre-235, specifically 61% as opposed to 49%.The proportion of denarii, of course, decreases in turn. Still, it is quite significant that both denarii and sestertii of the imperial period have been found in fairly large numbers, although very few hoards contain both bronze and silver coins in any significant quantity.Also, nearly 1.75 times the number of sestertii as denarii have been found in the region overall, including the hoard evidence. n nDenomination Hoard Site Find Total % of Total as 4 216 220 2 aureus 38 1 39 <1 denarius 4603 135 4738 35 dupondius 1 69 70 <1 dupondius/as 1 u00f8 1 <1 quadrans u00f8 10 10 <1 sestertius 8045 169 8214 61 unidentifiable bronze u00f8 186 186 <1 Total 12692 786 13478 n nUnderstanding the proportional representation of the different denominations is revealing, for the African evidence does not mirror the numismatic record from other parts of the Empire. This is especially striking in the case of the Gallic provinces, encompassing roughly the modern countries of France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and parts of western Germany.Roman Gaul was a large (although significantly smaller) and economically important region as was Roman Africa and has been home to some of the best numismatic research in the last several decades.Much, therefore, is known about the monetary history of the region in the imperial period. The consensus among scholars is that, during the second half of the third century CE, the tri-metallic monetary system of the high imperial period essentially collapsed into a bimetallic system u2013 the gold aureus and the billon antoninianus.23 In short, antoniniani dominate Gallic coin finds, while the vast majority of the non-antoniniani coins are bronze coins minted in the Antonine period, not later.24 n nMore importantly for the issue of denominational patterns, when discussing the rise of antoniniani in the western Empire during the third century, Estiot records that roughly 300,000 antoniniani have been found in the western half of the Empire in hoards, while an additional 30,000 have been identified in excavations; the vast majority of which were found in France, Belgium, or Britain.25 Presumably these figures include some of the African material, although Estiot did not attempt an exhaustive survey of African coins, but was rather mainly concerned with the evidence from northern Europe. Even if all of the African antoniniani were known to Estiot, I am able to reconstruct from the available evidence only 20,037 antoniniani recovered from Africa (Table 1), a mere 6% of the total number identified by Estiot.It is important to stress again that more coins have been found in Gaul and in Britain than in Africa overall, although, crucially, this is heavily weighted with antoniniani.Indeed, in an important study of third century coinage found in Gaul and Britain, Depeyrot and Hollard studied over 350,000 Roman coins minted between 238 and 276 CE found in 65 separate hoards, which in itself dwarfs the total number of coins I was able to identify from Africa for the entire high imperial period.26 Of these 350,000 mid-third century coins, the authors identify only 229 denarii, about 0.06% of the total, and no sestertii.27 n nInterestingly, my own albeit partial survey of the Gallic numismatic material likewise includes fewer denarii and sestertii from that region than from Africa. This search revealed 6,694 sestertii, less than the 8,214 known from Africa. I also found 3,360 denarii in Gallic hoards,28 compared with 4,738 from Africa.When the roughly 300,000 antoniniani identified from northern Europe by Estiot are considered, the number of denarii and sestertii from Gallic hoards represent on the order of 1-2% of the total number of pre-Aurelian coins known from the region, considerably less than the ratio from Africa.29 A similar picture emerges with the coins from Roman Britain. Indeed, a single hoard from Cunetio in southeastern Britain, one of the largest single collections of Roman coins ever found, offers a fairly representative picture of the circulation history of the region and encompasses in itself more than the total number of coins I have been able to identify from all of Africa.The Cunetio hoard features 54,951 coins dating from the late first century CE to the reign of Aurelian, of which only 630 are denarii (about 1.5% of the total) and only one sestertius.30 n nThis all implies strongly that antoniniani did not circulate to nearly the same extent in Africa during the mid-third century as they did in northern Europe. There are fewer denarii and sestertii known from the Gallic provinces and Britain than I have been able to gather from Africa.What this means in terms of the type of coins circulating in different parts of the Empire, then, is that the coin populations of Roman Africa seem to have been considerably more stable than in northern Europe at least up to the mid-third century;31 although in both regions the preponderance of antoniniani minting certainly had a significant effect on circulation patterns after 235 CE, sestertii and denarii remained in circulation after this date in greater numbers in Africa than elsewhere. n nb) Chronological Patterns n nPerhaps the most important patterns, and the aspect which most sets Africa u2019s monetary history apart from that of other areas of the western Empire, are the chronological ones. I mentioned above that Africa displays a more steady, stable numismatic record over the course of the high imperial period than can be seen in northern Europe. This is borne out by a close look at the chronological patterns.Figures 1 and 2 present histograms of the number of coins found in Africa, both hoards and site finds, by decade in which the coins were minted.32 These illustrations clearly reveal that there is a fairly steady representation of coins throughout the high imperial period. n nFigure 1 includes antoniniani, which represent the majority of overall coin finds, as noted above. Since this coinage was not minted before 215 CE, this skews the results towards the right half of the graph.Still, it is notable that there is an uneven distribution throughout the period when antoniniani were being minted in great numbers, after about 235 CE.Coins from the 260s and 270s are by far the most numerous of any category, representing 21% and 37% of the total, respectively.This further demonstrates that, while antoniniani came to dominate the circulation pattern of Africa as it did in the rest of the western Empire, this dominance did not occur until the 250s at earliest, well into the period when antoniniani were being minted. The relatively stable circulation pattern enjoyed by Africa is illustrated more plainly in Figure 2, which is a breakdown of coins by decade in which they were minted not including antoniniani.This Figure shows that nearly all decades of the high imperial period are well represented. n nMore significant is that the early 200s, covering the Severan period, are well-represented in the number of coin finds, shown clearly in Figure 2. This is important because, as mentioned, it is a very different pattern from that recorded in Gaul and Britain.Owing likely to a variety of factors including military, political, and economic turmoil along with dwindling metal supplies, the coinage circulating in northwestern Europe was essentially not restocked after the Antonine period, a gap that was eventually filled with antoniniani.33 As Estiot remarks, there is essentially a hiatus in the numismatic evidence from 193 to about 260 CE between the last nadir of minting good quality imperial silver and bronze coins in the late Antonine period and the appearance in huge numbers of antoniniani.34 Her remark, however, is based almost exclusively on evidence from northwestern Europe, on finds from Roman Gaul, Germany, and Britain; in the rest of the western Empire, namely Italy, Spain, and, of course, Africa, this gap is far less severe.35 #p31Further, finds from the different African provinces largely conform to this pattern as well. As can be seen in Figure 3, the distribution by mint date of coins found in Africa Proconsularis as well as in Mauretania Caesariensis are heavily skewed towards the 250s and later because of the large numbers of antoniniani found in these provinces.Conversely, Numidia and Mauretania Tingitana show more even distributions, although it is perhaps significant that Numidia shows many coins minted in the 220s through 240s, which may be related to the high rate of hoarding the province experienced during the strife of the 250s as scholars such as Salama have posited, discussed above. When antoniniani are not included, the distribution of all provinces is much more even (Figure 4).36 Crucially, Numidia still shows a large number of non-antoniniani minted after 220 CE, which strongly suggests that it was not simply high-quality Antonine and Severan issues which were hoarded in that region, as Salamas model would suggest.Figure 4a.Number of coins found in Africa Proconsularis by mint date, not including antoniniani (n=4,005) Figure 4b. Number of coins found in Numidia by mint date, not including antoniniani (n=7,019) Figure 4c.Number of coins found in Mauretania Caesariensis by mint date, not including antoniniani (n=1,776) Figure 4d.Number of coins found in Mauretania Tingitana by mint date, not including antoniniani (n=677) Figure 4 demonstrates that a large number of coins from the region were minted in the 200s, even when antoniniani are removed from analysis. The 160s CE produced the most coins found in the regionu2014during the relatively prosperous Antonine dynasty.The Severan period in the early third century, however, is likewise well represented.Further, only in the two Mauretanian provinces do coins minted earlier represent the largest group; Mauretania Caesariensis shows the most coins from the 30s and 60s CE in the first century CE, while the early second century produced the most number of coins found in Mauretania Tingitana. These results are significant, again, largely because they contrast so strongly with the patterns exhibited by other regions.Notably, when only non-antoniniani are included, Gaul shows a very even curve with the Antonine period being very well represented, typically with coins from the reigns of Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius the most frequent.37 Conversely, as discussed above, there is a conspicuous lack of Severan coins found throughout the Gallic provinces, which has led several scholars to assert that the coinage, particularly the bronze denominations, was essentially not restocked after the reign of Commodus. Figure 5.Number of coins found in Gaul by mint date, not including antoniniani (n=7,219) Another key revelation from this material is that denarii and sestertii are both found in relatively high numbers throughout Africa, as well as that large quantity of sestertii minted after the Antonine period have been found in the region.Coins of all denominations minted in the first and second centuries, up to the early Severan period, were circulating in Africa in relatively large numbers. Denarii and fractional bronzes show up in the region progressively rarely over the course of the third century, which is especially acute in site finds of the fractional bronzes, while antoniniani come to dominate the circulation pattern after 235 CE.The most curious feature of the pattern is that sestertii minted in the 200s CE do not exhibit a similar decline as the other non-antoniniani denominations, but are found in large numbers in both hoards and site finds. It is also notable that, although fewer denarii minted after 235 CE have been in Africa than specimens minted earlier, the denomination does not disappear completely until fairly late in the third century.This lends further support to the notion that Africa enjoyed a relatively stable monetary and economic life throughout the third century.It also suggests that, although the region likely did experience some inflationary tendencies after about 160 CE,38 inflation was not particularly severe there until the 250s at the earliest (I discuss the relationship between inflation and these changes in more detail below). The crucial point here is that both of these markers of stability are not echoed by the numismatic record of northern Europe.This picture is further confirmed by the circulation life of the coins found in Africa compared with those from Gaul.Admittedly, the notion that Roman Africa had a thriving economy for most of the imperial period is not an entirely novel one.The reason that the evidence presented here is important is in providing confirmation that the general impression given by other types of material from the region such as textual and epigraphic records; namely, that Africas market activity required a significant amount of coinage to pay wages, buy materials, and invest into the production of a variety of consumer goods.39 Furthermore, the suggestion that the African economy remained productive even during the turmoil of the mid-third century CE and that economic and financial difficulties were lower than in in the region than in other parts of the western Empire are perhaps more contentious ideas, yet they are certainly supported by the numismatic evidence. c) Regional Patterns Figure 6. Number of coins found in Africa by Province (n=33,514) The breakdown of coins found by province are illustrated in Table 5 and Figure 6.Striking in this regard is that the province of Numidia has produced the greatest number of coins minted before 235 CE, yet Africa Proconsularis contains the greatest number of coins overall.This requires elaboration.First, I will look at the patterns exhibited by the pre-235 CE coins, then turn to compare this with the evidence when all coins are considered.

The next most represented province is Africa Proconsularis, which has produced 2,725 coins, or 34% of the total, with Mauretania Caesariensis having produced about 9% and Mauretania Tingitana the remaining 8.5%.Additionally, these coins come from 66 different sites, including both hoards and site finds: 23 from Africa Proconsularis, 20 from Mauretania Tingitana, 13 from Numidia, and 10 from Mauretania Caesariensis (Table 6a). This is noteworthy, as Proconsularis and Mauretania Tingitana have the largest number of find-spots, although Numidia has the largest number of actual coins found.The Numidian finds, coming from 10 hoards and 3 excavated sites, therefore comprise more coins per find on average than in the other provinces.This observation, however, must be tempered by the fact that one exceptionally large hoard, that from Guelma, contains 2,787 coins, 72% of the Numidian total.40 Similarly, I was able to find records of coins produced by 13 separate excavations around the site of Thamasida in Mauretania Tingitana. I count these as 13 different find-spots; but if they were all counted as a single find-spot, then the total number of sites in Muaretania Tingitana from which I found numismatic records would fall from 20 to 8. These results deserve further comment.Table 6a.Number of sites where coins were found in Africa, by province and find context.DenominationtHoardtSite FindtTotal Proconsularist23t12t35 Numidiat23t3t26 Mauretania Caesariensist22t4t26 Mauretania Tingitanat9t14t23 Totalt77t33t110 Table 6b.Number of sites where coins minted before 235 CE were found in Africa, by province and find context.DenominationtHoardtSite FindtTotal Proconsularist14t9t22 Numidiat10t3t13 Mauretania Caesariensist8t2t10 Mauretania Tingitanat7t13t20 Totalt39t27t66 To begin with, while it is certainly important to distinguish which Roman province has left the greatest number of Roman coins for the modern scholar, these results must be taken with great caution. For, it is likely that the results are in large part being driven by modern circumstances, both the historical circumstances of the different countries in question as well as academic considerations.In short, more sustained numismatic research has been conducted in certain places and at certain times than in others.This may have resulted in more coins being discovered in Tunisia and Algeria than elsewhere, as these countries have the strongest pedigree of numismatic scholarship dating back to the French colonial period, a tradition scholars in both countries have maintained to the present. There are also certain historical reasons that could explain this geographical patterning.As Salama recently noted, Algerian hoards have produced a greater number of coins from the imperial period than any other country in North Africa.He attributes this largely to the military unrest which occurred in southern Numidia in the 250s CE as a result of invading tribes from the Atlas Mountain range.41 Indeed, Salama notes that 14 hoards found in Algeria and Morocco have terminal dates in the 250s and are mainly comprised of coins from the high Empire, namely minted before 235 CE. This suggests that the unrest of the 250s led to much insecurity and, therefore, an increased preponderance of non-recovered hoarding.Moreover, the fact that the regions hoards are so heavily weighted with coins minted before 235 CE indicates also that the turmoil led to a disruption in the distribution of coins from the mint at Rome, which fits with evidence from other regions of the Empire, discussed below. The idea is not that coins did not circulate in other regions, rather that there would have been less unrecovered hoards in the more peaceful regions, meaning fewer of these coins will have been unrecovered and so available for discovery by modern archaeology.This line of thought, however, begs the question of why Mauretania Caesariensis and Tingitana have produced so few coins, since the tribal revolts of the 250s affected these areas as much as, if not more than, western Numidia? Furthermore, the greatest number of hoards have been found in central and southern Tunisia, even though the total number of pre-235 CE coins found there is less than were found in Numidia (Table 5b).This belies Salamas hypothesis, for it can provide no explanation for the large number of hoards recovered from Proconsularis.It is, therefore, quite difficult to reach any definite conclusions about the geographical distribution of finds of imperial coins minted before 235 CE. It is clear that Africa Proconsularis has produced the greatest number of find-spots, if the coins recovered in excavations at Thamusida are counted as a single find-spot, yet Numidia has produced the greatest number of pre-235 CE minted coins regardless of context, showing perhaps a regional disparity in the reason for hoarding coins, although again this figure is biased by the exceptionally large Guelma hoard. Particularly confusing, and also intriguing, about the geographical distribution of coin finds is that the pattern of pre-235 CE coins does not persist when post-235 coins are included.When all coins minted in the high imperial period are considered, Africa Proconsularis becomes by far the most well represented province with 18,107 examples, 54% of the 33,514 coins known from all of Africa (Table 5a). Numidia is then the second most well represented, with 7,742 (23%) coins, followed closely by Mauretania Caesariensis with 6,072 (18%), then Mauretania Tingitana with 1,593 (5%).Critically, the distribution of the sites in which these coins were found is actually fairly similar to the pre-235 CE sample.Taking all of the imperial coins found in Africa together, I record a total of 110 separate find-spots: 35 from the territory of Africa Proconsularis; 26 from Numidia; 26 from Mauretania Caesariensis; and 23 from Mauretania Tingitana (Table 6b. Compare this with the results of Table 6a).This is particularly interesting since, when all coins are considered including antoniniani, the provincial distribution in terms of the number of find-spots echoes that of the number of coins found, with Africa Proconsularis the most represented province in both categories, followed by Numidia, Mauretania Caesariensis, and lastly Mauretania Tingitana.This is not the case with only the pre-235 CE coins. The chief driving force behind the different regional patterns of number of coins exhibited by pre- and post-235 CE finds is clearly the antoniniani which, as discussed, were minted after the 230s in immense quantities and which seem to have circulated most heavily in Africa Proconsularis.For, looking at the full period 23 BCE-275 CE and excluding antoniniani (Table 5c), Numidia is the most well-represented province, providing 52% of the coins I was able to find, with Proconsularis at 30%, Mauretania Caesariensis 13%, and Mauretania Tingitana 5%. Antoniniani, therefore, seem to have circulated in Africa Proconsularis to a significantly greater degree than they did in the other provinces.Moreover, this leads to the important conclusion that a model centered on the notion that conflict drives hoarding and therefore the frequency of coin finds is somewhat flawed,42 for no conflict can be posited to account for the dramatic rise of antoniniani circulating and hoarded in Africa Proconsularis during the second half of the third century CE. An intriguing alternative explanation is that, while turmoil may represent one significant factor in the recovery rate of coins from a given area, the general monetary and economic health of that region may be equally important.Exploring the context of coin finds from Roman Africa offers some hint at how this model may help explain the patterns observed here. d) Contextual Patterns The final pattern I will comment on is the context in which African coins were foundu2014in a hoard or as a site find. Generally, large numbers of coins grouped togetheru2014hoardsu2014typically represent the accumulated wealth of an individual, family, or a group like a military legion or trade organization, and generally are made up of the highest-valued coins available to the hoarder.Conversely, site finds represent the lower-valued coins in circulation and are, in essence, 'loose change' lost or discarded during everyday activity and not recovered because the loss was unknown or was not worth the effort to recover. A relatively low but steady loss-rate of low denomination coins, thus, fits with the idea that Africa enjoyed a well-functioning monetized economy; an economy featuring, on the one hand, enough small-scale activity so that enough of such coins were in demand that they were lost and unrecovered with some regularity, yet, on the other hand, there was a high enough need for the coins that they were not discarded in any large quantity. Contrarily, higher value currency such as the silver denarius was useful as a store of value or for large-scale activity such as state expenditure or the exchange of luxury or bulk goods, things which occur less frequently than smaller-scale expenses and which require the accumulation of large groups of coins.This would explain why denarii are most commonly found in hoards.Sestertii, then, exist on the border of the two categories, for they are useful both in daily transactions such as paying wages on a local scale or for buying modest quantities of consumer goods, but also seem to have functioned as a store of value. Consistent with this, we see sestertii from North Africa found in relatively large numbers in hoards but also showing up as site finds.This also explains Africa's denominational patterns discussed above: a relatively stable supply of very low value bronze asses as site finds up to the late second century; a fairly steady loss rate of the medium-value bronze sestertii throughout the imperial period; and an increasing number of high-value silver denarii being lost over the course of the second century leading up to the introduction of the antoninianus in the mid-third century. It is curious to note from Figure 6 that Mauretania Tingitana is the only region where site finds outnumber finds of hoarded coins, largely due to the excavations at Thamusida which have produced many coins.43 In the other provinces, hoarded coins far exceed the number of stray finds found.Of the 110 coin find-spots that I have identified from Africa (Table 6b), 77 are hoards, while 33 are site finds from excavated contexts. Moreover, it is important to stress that most of the known hoards have terminal dates after 235 CE, namely 52 (68%).44 This means that the majority of the hoards known from Africa which contain imperial coinage were hoarded after 235 CE, a pattern that largely mimics that known from northern Europe.This may seem to lend support to the notion that some turmoil in the mid-third century caused a massive increase in the frequency of hoarding throughout Africa. As I discuss above, however, military conflict appears unable to explain the entire pattern of hoarding from Africa, so likely this would be political or, more likely, financial turmoil driving this pattern. I return to this critical observation in the following section.Figure 7a.Average estimated number of years in circulation of antoniniani found in hoards, showing coins found in Africa (blue; n=20,037) compared with those found in Gaul (red; n=6,356) Figure 7b. Average estimated number of years in circulation of sestertii found in hoards, showing coins found in Africa (blue; n=8,214) compared with those found in Gaul (red; n=6,694) This overall picture is further supported by the circulation life of the coins found in Africa compared with those from Gaul.As mentioned at the beginning of this section, my survey of the Gallic coins focused on the antoniniani and sestertii, so I will focus for these coins for comparison. Figure 7a illustrates the estimated circulation life of antoniniani found in African versus Gallic hoards.The average estimated circulation life is 5 years, similar to the Gallic antoniniani which show an average circulation life of 7 years.45 African sestertii, contrarily, have an average circulation life of only 45 years, compared with Gallic sestertii which circulated on average for 70 years (Figure 7b). The denarii contained in my database mirror this as well, with African denarii circulating for an average of 38 years and Gallic denarii for 95 years, although it is important to stress again that my survey of the Gallic denarii is not as exhaustive as my survey of the Gallic sestertii, so I do not illustrate this finding here.It is also worth noting that African asses and dupondii show the expected pattern, circulating on average 123 and 141 years, respectively.46 This, of course, does not mean that these coins were actually used in market transactions in each year for over a century. What it shows is simply that the majority of these types of coins which were found in Africa came in hoards which included also coins minted much later, meaning that the coins were available in the monetary system to be gathered and hoarded at a later date, or were part of u2018savings hoardsu2014groups of coins not compiled all at once but accumulated through time.47 The central point here is simply that these low-value coins were deemed worthy of inclusion in hoards either compiled in or persisting into the late second and third century, as most African hoards were, which again relates to Africas relative fiscal and economic stability. The question may fairly be asked whether it is worthwhile at all to even include evidence from site finds in such a numismatic overview.There is, in fact, great scholarly debate over exactly how to treat individual coins recovered as site finds, especially regarding the extent to which the stray finds of any given archaeological site reflect a true cross-section of the coinage which actually circulated during a given period.48 The problem is essentially the opposite of the issues with hoarded coins; coins lost accidentally or casually thrown away are generally the lowest denomination, most heavily worn coins in circulation at a given time and place. The picture that emerges from a study of stray finds, then, is strongly biased towards low value currency, whereas it is typically the highest value, heaviest, most pristine examples available to a person which are hoarded.Moreover, the number of site finds from a given area depends in large part on the number of large-scale excavations conducted in that area, whereas hoards are often found even without the deliberate exertion of effort to find them. Consequently, the focus of numismatic scholarship has traditionally been on hoarded coins, as hoards have been the most widely available and accessible context producing Roman coins.In a very important article, Reece argued that site finds should be subjected to closer scholarly scrutiny than they have in the past.49 He notes that there are 3 basic assumptions that make excavated, stray coinage suitable to analysis: first, that in a well conducted excavation, the coins uncovered will be close to the actual amount of coin loss at the site in antiquity; second, that the coins lost on a site must bear some relationship to the coinage in circulation at any given period, even if the precise relationship is not immediately apparent; and lastly, that it is possible to discern the major factors which produce stray coin finds. He expands on this third point, noting that a coin is most likely to be lost and unrecovered on a particular site: a) when it is among the least valuable coins in circulation; b) when it is small compared to other examples of the same type (which likewise has to do with the coins value, since smaller coins contain less metal); c) when it is dull, namely heavily worn; d) when there are more of that type of coin circulating than other types; and e) when there is more money in general circulating at the site than at other sites, i.e. that the loss rate of coins is related to the overall level of monetization.50 These arguments convincingly show that it is necessary to include analyses of site finds in order to judge what patterns these coins exhibited and how those patterns relate to the hoarded material, as long as the distinction between these radically different contexts is properly maintained. In terms of chronological arrangement, the site finds and hoarded material exhibit roughly the same pattern, with the majority of coins recovered as site finds minted in the third century CE.The denominational pattern is a little different, for site finds nearly always feature a greater concentration of lower value coinage than the hoarded material, as expected.While antoniniani comprise the majority of both hoard and site finds, they make up only 32% of the site finds, but 61% of the hoarded material. Moreover, there are proportionally fewer aurei, denarii, and sestertiiu2014 the higher value currencyu2014in site finds compared with hoards and consequently greater representation of the less valuable fractional bronze denominations, the as, dupondius, and quadrans, as well as the heavily worn and fractional unidentified bronzes recovered as site finds.This is all calculated from the data in Table 1.The most revealing analysis is to track the denominations represented by site finds over time. This is because, as Reece notes, typically the lowest coinage in circulation at any given site at any given time will be lost in greatest quantity, so a change in the denominational pattern of lost coins over time will indicate something about the areas monetary history.51 Figure 8 offers a comparison between the chronological distribution of the as, dupondius, sestertius, denarius, and antoninianus from site finds versus hoards. These graphs reveal some change over time, as the frequency with which asses and dupondii, relatively low-value coins, were lost sharply decreases after the 160s CE, while the loss rate of the denarius increases fairly steadily over time.Curiously, the sestertius loss rate does not mirror that of the denarius, but sestertii are lost at a fairly steady rate during most of the Antonine period as well as the late Severan period. This again suggests that Africa experienced some inflation after the 160s, since the increasing frequency of denarius losses coupled with the increasing rarity of losses of fractional bronzes suggests that the coin was progressively losing purchasing power and, thus, were becoming more 'losable'.This notion, however, is somewhat belied by the fact that sestertii continued to be lost at a steady rate along with denarii in the early third century. Perhaps the best explanation is that the region experienced an initial period of inflation in the later half of the second century CE, but that currency values more or less leveled off and remained fairly stable for the next 150 years.Once more, this pattern is fruitfully compared to the situation in northern Europe.Post-Antonine period finds in the Gallic provinces are very rare, which includes site finds as well as hoards. This has been convincingly interpreted52 as the result of fairly drastic debasements to the currency, resulting in a relatively severe degree of currency inflation, if not general price inflation.Such inflation would not only prompt the lower value denominations to be minted less frequently, but also could be the cause of the nearly complete disappearance of coins of all denominations from circulation after the Antonine period, something not observed in Africa. The distribution of coins lost in Gaul, thus, is much more staggered than in Africa, for it shows a fairly steady loss rate until the middle of the second century CE, then a near total gap until the later 230s when antoniniani came to flood the markets of northern Europe, as discussed above.Another crucial issue for which the evidence from site finds is potentially helpful is the degree of monetization in the different parts of the Roman world. As Reece notes, the more coins there are circulating at a given place and time, the more individual coins will be lost and not recovered.Yet, this relationship is not as simple as it may first appear.Reece himself hinted at this in an earlier publication, pointing out that a slow and steady representation of coinage produced by an excavation implies that the site enjoyed a normal, regular supply of coinage for frequent and general use.53 The idea being, in other words, that a highly functioning monetary system will produce a steady yet relatively low rate of coin loss, since the coins in such an environment would be used frequently enough that only a very few of the lowest value coins will be allowed to be lost and unrecovered. In a less active market environment, on the other hand, coins would be stock-pilled for a variety of purposes, such as at an army camp to be distributed to soldiers as their salary.54 Since the coins would be gathered together in a large group but actually used in market transactions less frequently, there would be less chance for individual low-value coins to be lost and scattered around a site.The most convincing idea to explain why a very large number of stray coins would be found in an excavation is that rapid debasement or a dramatic change in the monetary system suddenly makes a particular group of coins essentially valueless or demonetized, yet the intrinsic value of the coins' metal is not affected by the rising commodity prices brought on by inflation, so they are discarded in great numbers. Thus, a well-functioning market economy should exhibit a coin-loss rate somewhere in between the very sparse rate expected from an under-monetized area and the great number of coins expected to be lost in staggered rates during a period of monetary instability.This is of vital importance, for it suggests that the relatively steady yet still small amount of lost coins recorded in African archaeological sites is indicative of a well-functioning and highly monetized market based on numerous and frequent transactions involving the exchange of coin. This idea certainly deserves greater attention, although it is a very difficult notion to test as it relies essentially on an ex silentio argument, for it is concerned as much with the amount of coins not found as with the coins which were actually lost.Moreover, there is no threshold given for how many coins can be lost per year that indicate a well functioning monetized market before the loss rate becomes large enough to represent a different sort of market environment. Still, it is an appealing idea and would seem to explain the evidence fairly well, particularly the relatively steady but low loss rates of sestertii and asses experienced in Africa, since these were the two principal denominations used in medium- and small-scale market transactions.What Does Africa's Numismatic Record Reveal About Rome's Monetary System?The preceding discussion of the contextual patterns, including site finds alongside hoarded material, points to a different mode of coin distribution and use than has traditionally been thought. Indeed, numismatists and scholars of ancient monetary history typically assume that there was in all periods a strong link between state activity, particularly the needs of military personnel, and coinage.The central problem with models of Roman coinage focused only on state needs and particularly on military spending is that they leave little room for understanding how coins could have circulated without the mediation of large numbers of soldiers, yet there is an abundance of economic activity observable in many parts of the Roman world, including Africa, that seem not to involve the military at all. Africa featured only one legion, the legio III Augusta, whose main camp was moved from Numidia to near Lambaesis in Mauretania Caesariensis under Hadrian to be closer to the Aures Mountain ranges, the main area of turmoil throughout the imperial period including the revolts of the 250s CE.There were also auxiliary forces, most of which were based in camps or forts in southern Numidia and Mauretania Caesariensis, although many of these military bases were constructed during the second half of the third century precisely in response to these invasions from the Aures Mountain range.55 For most of the imperial period, then, the entire region was relatively under-militarized compared with other parts of the Empire, notably northern Europe.56 Crucially, analyzing the full range of Africa's numismatic evidence together demonstrates that the majority of coins found in the region come from Numidia and Africa Proconsularis and not in the areas of the two Mauretanian provinces where much of the military manpower of the region was concentrated. It is possible that soldiers in the two Mauretanian provinces used their pay to purchase goods from merchants who then took that money to Numidia and Proconsularis, or that many soldiers ended up moving to these eastern Provinces to spend their money there.Still, if soldiers pay was the initial and primary focus of coin distribution, we should expect to see numismatic material from the areas where these soldiers were concentrated at least on par with, if not greater than, the material left in less militarized areas. Army presence alone, then, simply cannot have been the central driving force behind the supply of coins to the region.Certainly, the state had other financial commitments besides the army that could have prompted the minting and distribution of coins into North Africa.The state had employees in each province, such as governors, proconsules, legates, etc., as well as other support staff who all needed to be paid in some form, potentially with coins. Moreover, public works projects organized and paid for by state finances would have put money into provincial markets.Still, this activity does not really explain the production or distribution of smaller-denomination currency in Africa or any other region.It is fairly clear, further, that only a very small portion of the imperial budget was spent in Africa;57 in other words, neither military spending, the salaries of imperial officials, nor imperial construction projects or largess of other sorts could have provided enough of an impetus to explain the numismatic evidence from the region as it currently stands. This, then, leaves two potential avenues to explain the distribution of this currency: firstly, that coins minted in Rome were distributed in Africa in large part to meet the economic needs of private citizensu2014directly as wages, indirectly as bulk shipments of coins (to money-changers, perhaps?), distributed through monetary transactions, etc.u2014that is, uses not tied directly to the activity of the state; or, secondly, that coins were brought into the region from economic exchanges between African producers and consumers elsewhere in the Empire. This latter possibility is appealing, although as Duncan-Jones notes monetized exchange should have created fairly homogeneous numismatic profiles in the different regions of the Roman Mediterranean, yet this is clearly not what the evidence reveals.58 Importantly, in both of these scenarios it is the needs of economic agents in Africa driving the distribution of coinage in the region, whether as producers of exchangeable goods or as consumers in a monetized market, rather than the needs of the Roman state.59 This idea has, in fact, been proposed in the past, although rarely with regards to the high imperial period.60 Working with the coinage uncovered by the British Excavations at Carthage, Reece notably concluded that the period of Vandal control over North Africa in the fifth and sixth centuries CE marked the first time that coins started to be minted and distributed to the region entirely to meet the demand of the general public, rather than for state needs.61 His reasoning is based on the fact that virtually all Vandal coins found in Carthage are small denomination copper, which he argues is pointless for the state purposes of paying high officials, or overseas trade, but is just what is needed for the markets. 62 As is evident from the analyses of the numismatic material explored in this article, Roman Africa likewise saw a fairly steady supply of lower denomination coins throughout the high imperial period.This does not mean necessarily that Reeces logic is flawed, but it does require that the willingness of a state to mint coins for reasons other than their own needs must at the very least be backdated before the Vandal conquest.63 As Reece himself admitted, we still know very little about coin supply in North Africa in the 4th , or earlier for that matter. 64 What we do know is that, until the 250s CE at least, people in all of the African provinces had access to the full range of Roman coinsu2014low- and high-valueu2014that the vast majority of coins found in Africa were minted at the state-run mint at Rome, and that spending on soldier salaries cannot have been the primary conduit by which coins minted in Rome ended up circulating in Africa. It is, in fact, one of the great mysteries of Roman coin production whether the imperial minting authorities took it upon themselves to decide when and in what quantities to send low value coins to different regions, or if the call for coins came from some authority or private citizen in the province receiving them.There is actually some evidence from the eastern Empire for this latter scenario.An inscription found at Rhodiopolis in Lycia from the second century CE honors Opramoas, a private benefactor of Rhodiopolis, for having paid for bronze coins to be minted at Rome and shipped to Rhodiopolis in order to be used by the citys residents.65 This suggests that the usefulness of small change in performing market transactions was recognized by people outside of the state apparatus, and there was demand from the users of coins to remain liquid in terms of the cash supply. Perhaps professional money-changers or bankers regularly 'bought' coinage from the mint in order to distribute to local consumers, charging, of course, a fee for the exchange.66 There was one major difference between the eastern and western portions of the Empire in terms of minting system, namely that civic mints throughout the East continued to mint their own bronze coins throughout the imperial period, unlike in the West where all coins were minted Rome during the second and most of third centuries CE. Unfortunately, no direct evidence of a similar procedure as what Opramoas undertakes survives from anywhere in the western half of the Empire.Still, local demand for coinage is a very persuasive alternate explanation for how and why coins ended up in the Roman provinces without appealing to soldiers presence.The key question here is why the Roman state would incur the costs of producing and distributing such large quantities of so many different types of coins for such a long period? In other words, what did the central imperial authorities get out of Romes state-controlled minting?It must be stressed here that the act of transforming metal into coined money was itself a fairly complicated, laborious, and, most importantly, expensive undertaking in any preindustrial society, particularly the ancient world.One of the main problems faced by ancient (and, for that matter, modern) minting authorities is that coins minted in low-value metals like bronze have much smaller marginal returns than silver or gold coins, since the production costsu2014mining ore, smelting, shipping the metal, melting the refined metal, shaping flans, producing dies, stamping the coins, transporting them towards the final users and tracking every step of the processu2014are roughly equivalent regardless of the metal involved. Yet, coins made from high-value metals provide a much greater return to the state which bears the cost of minting in terms of the buying power of the coins once minted than coins of less valuable metal.67 This seems, in fact, to be one of the reasons that scholars have long associated minting with large-scale state expenditure, as the easiest explanation for why an ancient state would bear the cost of minting coins is to assume that high-value coins were predominantly produced and that the main motivation was to cover the expenses incurred by the ruling authorities, namely paying soldiers and other dependents as well as rewarding loyal supporters and administrators. Surely, it is notable in this regard that the earliest coin-producing states in Asia Minor and in the Greek world concentrated on high-value metals like electrum and silver, and did not introduce low-value bronze coins until the very end of the fifth century BCE.68 It is, though, difficult to reconcile the appearance of low-value coinage with this line of reasoning.Moreover, this discussion of minting costs boils down to the idea that the real economic value of a coin to the minting authority in terms of its buying power must surpass the cost of minting that coin, otherwise the state mints at a deficit, which is unsupportable in the long term. Clearly, then, the higher the real value of the coin being minted, the easier it is for the minting authority to recover the costs of production; essentially, the marginal cost of coin production is inversely proportional to the value of the metal used in the coin.69 Further, there were limits to how small or light the state could make individual coins and still have them be large enough to be actually usable by people and acceptable as a legitimate currency.70 Thus, Roman bronze coins were only slightly fiduciary, meaning that the nominal, or face, value of the coins was not too far from their intrinsic value, or the value of the metal contained in the coin as a commodity.71 Significantly, the small marginal return from bronze coins which circulated at something approaching their intrinsic value as compared with the return on silver or gold coins means that bronze coins were particularly susceptible to changes in the value of the metal. In other words, a modest rise in the commodity price of the metals needed to produce bronze coins could push the production cost over the margin, making the cost of procuring and minting the raw material greater than the finished coins economic value.72 This may, in fact, have been one of the reasons for the abandonment of bronze denominations in favor of the billon antoninianus in the 230s CE.Given how costly it was to produce bronze coins compared to other denominations and given that silver and gold coins provided such a greater return in terms of spending power, the imperial authorities must have had some compelling reason for supporting a tri-metallic monetary system for as long as they did. The desire for small-denomination currency to use in low-value, daily transactions should not be discounted as a motive for the minting authorities.This is not meant to imply any great altruistic motive the Roman state had to support the welfare of the poor.Rather, I am arguing that it was in the states own interests to keep markets stocked with official low-denomination coinage.73 This is largely because transactions will occur whether or not the state is involved, meaning that counterfeit coins are made in increasing quantities when the official coins are insufficient to meet the demands of the market.74 Large quantities of imitation coins circulating in a given area can devastate a market, causing inflationary spikes or lack of trust in the coinage due to an unregulated increase in the amount of money in the economy and driving good quality coins out of circulation. Further, the state had a definite interest in ensuring that its high-value currency maintained its real economic value.75 This is important, because any change in the supply or value of one metal affects the others, for there was always an official exchange rate between the different denominations.Thus, if the intrinsic value of one denomination changed, it would put stress on the nominal rate at which the coin was exchanged with other coins. That would exacerbate inflationary periods, since the affected coin will effectively cease to be accepted in transactions at the official tariff as its nominal exchange rate no longer mimics its intrinsic value.In order for the state to continue to receive some return on minting the silver and gold coins which it used to meet its largest financial obligations, then, the value of the bronze denominations had to remain fairly stable. Thus, it was absolutely crucial to keep all parts of the tri-metallic monetary system intact.76 Support for these views is given by the appearance in very large numbers of imitation coins, especially imitation antoniniani, in northern Europe during the second half of the third century at a time when the area was insufficiently stocked with bronze coins, as noted above.Perhaps the most compelling explanation for why bronze coins gradually ceased to be produced and sent to these areas is that some combination of inflation and depleting metal stocks had driven up the commodity price of copper and the other metals needed for producing bronze. Since bronze coins were minted at a relatively low marginal return, at least when compared to the denarius and especially the antoninianus, this inflation would have caused bronze coins to be more costly to produce than the value they returned to the state qua coinage.Conclusion This article seeks to contribute to the field of Roman numismatics by offering a detailed overview of a large database containing detailed records of the imperial Roman coins recovered in North Africa. This database is the result of years of research.The chief value of this paper is offering the database to scholars, as it represents the most comprehensive collection of the Roman coinage found in North Africa during the first three centuries CE produced to date; though it is nevertheless incomplete, and is in want of further attention by numismatics and economic historians.This database has been utilized to investigate the Roman Africa's monetary and economic history. Some results from these analyses have been summarized here.In particular, I explore several key issues of Roman monetary and economic history; the relationship between coin finds and economic activity, the peculiarity of Roman Africa compared with the rest of the western Empire, particularly in the tumultuous third century CE, and the ways that consumer demand impacted minting and the distribution of coined money from Rome to a peripheral area such as North Africa. The key contribution that this article makes, however, is in providing access to the complete set of numismatic evidence. I mentioned very briefly in the introduction that scholars of antiquity are now beginning to realize the enormous potential of data-driven approaches to ancient history and the utility of open-access digital publications.This approach, though, requires that scholars allow general access to the material that informs and underlies the conclusions and interpretations offered about any number of topics concerning the ancient world. This is an unfamiliar practice to most scholars who deal with material, whether numismatic, epigraphic, ceramic, etc.Traditionally, the practice has been to produce overviews and articles on specific, narrowly-defined topics, keeping the data behind the arguments private and guarded.The database presented here is the result of years of research and effort pulling information from a variety of numismatic publications and resources scattered around the United States and Europe. It is important to ensure that I reap the proper rewards from this effort in terms of publications and credit, yet it would be disadvantageous for everyone to make any other scholar interested in the monetary history of Roman Africa repeat this labor; much better that we both have the opportunity to utilize the data that has already been collected, employing our efforts instead in adding to the body of material and performing interesting analyses on it to reach novel conclusions. In this same vein, another advantage of providing open access to such a database is that combining data from multiple sources produces larger datasets than would be possible for any individual to amass on their own.This, in turn, allows new and powerful analyses to be run, which can illuminate new aspects of the material as well as support interesting interpretations on a broader range of topics and areas that could not have been reached without accessible data. Several collaborative, interdisciplinary research projects have, in fact, been put together seeking to take advantage of the opportunities for large-scale, cross-cultural and diachronic analysis.77 The final and perhaps most important benefit of this publication is that exposing the evidence that forms the basis of a scholarly argument allows the research to be reproducible and, thereby, defensible. This aspect should not be undervalued, as the lack of reproducibility and falsifiability is arguably a major weakness of humanities research today.78 This article, along with the appended database, thus, seeks to contribute to future research that can take advantage of all three of these benefits, in addition to enriching the study of the monetary and economic history of Roman North Africa generally."
