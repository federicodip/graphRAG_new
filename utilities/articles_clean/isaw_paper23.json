  "text": "ARTICLE_ID: isaw_paper23\nBook VII of the Almagest presents one of the most enduring parts of Hellenistic astronomy, that is, the theory of precession.Ptolemy points to Hipparchus of Nicaea (c. -190 2013 c. -120) as the one responsible for its discovery.As part of the discussion surrounding precession Ptolemy introduces us to a discussion which, distant as it may be from our 2013and possibly Ptolemys2013 theoretical perspective, appeared as a genuinely interesting debate in Hipparchus times are all the stars subjected to precession, or does it only affect the zodiacal ones? Implicit in this question is another, more general one are the so-called fixed stars truly fixed?In order provide an answer to them, Ptolemy tells us that Hipparchus determined many stellar configurations.While most of the ones Ptolemy refers to are straight lines formed by three or more stars, it is possible that the original set was much more varied.After presenting the Hipparchian configurations and declaring that they remained, about three centuries later, as they were in Hipparchus times, Ptolemy gives the reader a new set of configurations of his own, in order to provide future astronomers with a more secure basis to check the hypothesis that the stars are all fixed in position relative to each other.2b08#p1In this paper I will give a detailed study of these configurations. As far as I know, this is the first complete analysis of the stellar configurations in the Almagest.Nevertheless, some important work has already been done.First and foremost, we have the notes and commentaries in both Manitius (1913) and Toomers (1984) modern translations.As will become obvious, they served as the main sources on which my work rests, even if it is to 2013occasionally2013 criticize them. Secondly, (Pedersen, 2010) and (Evans, 1998), even if they are works with a much wider scope, both provide some important insight into what role the stellar configurations played in Ptolemys Almagest.2b08#p2The first section of the paper deals with some necessary clarifications regarding the methods I use to evaluate the stellar configurations.After that, the second section goes into the list of Hipparchian configurations that Ptolemy refers in the Almagest. As I said, I will consider the configurations one by one, and accompany each one with the corresponding illustration.In the third section I will do the same with the configurations that Ptolemy presents as his own.The following two sections are a general analysis of the alignments given by both astronomers, and a comparison between some alignments located in the same signs, which could shed some light into the question of the origin of some Ptolemaic alignments.2b08#p3Methodological clarifications.The Almagest indicates various kinds of stellar configurations. From the 26 configurations Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus, 22 are alignments or quasi-alignments between three or four stars.There is one description of an isosceles triangle, one description of two lines being parallel, and two descriptions of a line bisecting another.2b08#p4Regarding his own configurations, I counted 23, 21 of which are stellar alignments or quasi alignments.The rest consists of one description of an isosceles triangle, and one of a line bisecting another.2b08#p5Hence, by far the majority of the configurations described in the Almagest are descriptions of three or four stars being in the same line, or close to it. This should not come as a surprise, since Ptolemy himself says that he has given the configurations 201c[2026] which are most suitable for easy comprehension and also for giving an overview of the whole method of comparison [2026]201d (Toomer, 1984 322).The line is, of course, the simplest geometric configuration he could have chosen.Because he is looking at a sphere, we can confidently say that what Ptolemy is referring to when speaking about an 03b51f5003b803b51fd603b1, is a great circle of that sphere.2b08#p6When he describes the alignments, Ptolemy uses different expressions. Many times he indicates that the stars lie on a straight line, in some occasions qualifying the positions as 201calmost on a straight line201d.In other numerous occasions, though, he first points to two stars, and then indicates how far the line they determine passed from a given third star.This distance is never great, at least according to his records.This ambivalence in the expressions used in the descriptions must be considered carefully. The descriptions of a star being at a certain distance from a line determined by two stars can be checked directly.In fact, in (Meeus, 1998 124) there is a formula for calculating exactly that distance.However, when checking the configurations that the Almagest describes as 201cstraight lines201d or 201calmost straight lines201d, one must take into consideration another datum in order to make a fuller assessment of the accuracy of the description.2b08#p7Refer to Figure 1. Lines AB and DE represent two lines between pairs of stars.In the first case, a third star C is at a given distance from line AB.This distance is equal to the one between point F to line DE in the second case.However, ACB is more straight-like than CFE.This shows that the distance of the middle star to the line between the two extreme stars cannot, by itself, be a good measure of the accuracy of the description. Instead, I will also measure the angle at the middle star, in Figure 1.To do it, I will use the formula given in (Meeus, 1998 125).2b08#p8The measurement of the distance from the middle star to the line determined by the other two has it place, though.In Figure 1, if line AB is not great, then it is likely that the distance of C to that line is negligible or very small.But if AB is large, then the distance from C to it may be noticeable. So, even if the angle at C is the same in two different cases, one may be a good alignment and the other one not.2b08#p9Because of these ambiguities in what it constitutes a good alignment, in the cases described as 201cstraight lines201d or 201calmost straight lines201d, I will give both data.If in some case I depart from this criterion, the reasons will be made clear as needed.12b08#p10Another difficulty is presented in the case where Ptolemy describes two lines in the celestial sphere as being parallel. Because there are no parallel great circles in spherical geometry, the natural interpretation is that, because the lines he indicates are so short, they can be seen as two straight lines on a plane.So, to analyze that case, I will assume this, and determine the angle at which both lines will intersect in order to determine how close they were to being parallel.The method I used to do that is described in Appendix 1.2b08#p11The rest of the configurations offer no special difficulties in order to analyze the isosceles triangle I simply compare the distances between the apex and the two stars at the base, using the formula given in (Meeus, 1998 109). Finally, the cases of a line bisecting another are studied by comparing the size of both parts of the bisected line.The method I used to do that is described in Appendix 2.2b08#p12I will use as reference Toomers identifications of the stars, as indicated in the notes to his translation of the Almagest.In the vast majority of the cases, Toomer follows Manitius identifications.So, when I discuss Toomers identifications, as a rule the reader should understand that I am referring to an identification by Manitius that Toomer has found satisfactory. In some cases, though, Toomer offers (with various degrees of confidence) alternative identifications.In these instances I have done my best to support one or the other with arguments not found in either work.Finally, in some few cases I offer my own identification (also with various degrees of confidence).2b08#p13In all cases, the positions of the stars were computed using the data provided by the Hipparcos Catalogue. Stellar proper motion was accounted for.The years I used as reference for the Hipparchian and Ptolemaic stellar positions are -150 and 140, respectively.The magnitudes of the stars were provided by the Tycho Catalogue.2b08#p14The images that go with each configuration were made using Stellarium 0.19.2.There is some variation between the manner in which the Almagest describes the positions of some stars within a given constellation, and how the program depicts them in the constellation drawing. Thus, the images should only be taken as orientative depictions.2b08#p15Hipparchus configurations.As I noted in the introduction, Ptolemy presents Hipparchus stellar configurations in the context of his exposition on the 201cso called fixed stars201d in Almagest VII 1.There, he tells us that the stars are fixed in the sense that their relative positions remain unchanged through time, but that they are not fixed with respect to the equinoctial points. Both hypotheses are explicitly attributed to Hipparchus, and the chapter is merely intended to serve as a confirmation based on a more secure observational basis.As Ptolemy puts it, 201c[2026] our examination is conducted [with material taken] from a longer time-interval, and because the fixed-star observations recorded by Hipparchus, which are our chief source for comparisons, have been handed down to us in a thoroughly satisfactory form.201d (Toomer, 1984 321).2b08#p16The comparison of the stellar positions is aimed at supporting the first of these tenets, that is, that the stars remain fixed in their relative positions. The second one, which he calls the rearward motion of the stars, Hipparchus called the 201cdisplacement of the solsticial and equinoctial points201d (Toomer, 1984 327), and is modernly called precession of the equinoxes, will be dealt with in a following section.2b08#p17Ptolemys text, however, reveals that in the course of his study on the relative positions of the stars Hipparchus changed his mind regarding the extension of their hypothesized relative immobility. When Ptolemy asserts that the stars on the entire celestial sphere are in fixed positions to one another, he says that 201cThis is true not only of the positions of the stars in the zodiac relative to each other, or of the stars outside the zodiac relative to other stars outside the zodiac (which would still be the case if only stars in the vicinity of the zodiac had a rearward motion, as Hipparchus proposes in the first hypothesis he puts forward); but is also true of the positions of stars in the zodiac relative to those outside it, even those at considerable distances.201d (Toomer, 1984 322, italics are mine)2b08#p18Ptolemy is implying that Hipparchus initially though that the rearward motion of the stars only affected those within the boundaries of the zodiac. Thus, the relative immobility would only apply within the set of zodiacal stars on the one hand, and within the set of extra zodiacal stars on the other, but not to sets of stars comprised of the two kinds.It is clear that Ptolemy does not hold this position, but instead had understood that all the stars undergo the rearward motion (i.e., a motion in the direction of increasing longitude), and thus that all their relative positions remain unchanged. The fact that he indicates that the former was only 201cthe first hypothesis201d Hipparchus had put forward already suggests that Hipparchus himself had, at some point, abandoned it for a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of precession.The very fact that Hipparchus work about precession was called 201cOn the displacement of the solsticial and equinoctial points201d confirms that his final understanding regarding this aspect of the problem was identical to Ptolemys if the objects that moved where those points instead of the stars, then all the stars will move relative to them. As we will see, the Hipparchian alignments Ptolemy quotes confirm this interpretation.2b08#p19In the following sections I will provide a study of each of the Hipparchian configurations given in the Almagest with a commentary, and the corresponding images.The order will be the same as the Almagests.All positional values will only be given for -150, i.e., the times of Hipparchus.2b08#p20Cancer.1) [Hipparchus] records that the star in the southern claw of Cancer, the bright star which is in advance of the latter and of the head of Hydra, and the bright star in Procyon lie almost on a straight line. For the one in the middle lies 1 00bd digits to the north and east of the straight line joining the two end ones, and the distances [from it to each of them] are equal.2b08#p21Refer to Illustration 1.Toomer identifies the three stars as 03b1 Cnc, 03b2 Cnc, and 03b1 CMi respectively.He notes (322, note 4) that the north-east position cannot be right, and I agree.He calculates that in Hipparchus time 03b2 Cnc lay about 500b4 to the north-west of the line (Toomer, 1984 322, note 4). This would give a good coincidence with the 1 00bd digits Ptolemy quotes.22b08#p22By my calculations, the line was 20.0300b0 long, and 03b2 Cnc lay 25.5200b4 to the north-west of the line, a considerable difference from the Almagests account, and Toomers calculations.The distance between 03b1 Cnc and 03b2 Cnc was 10.600b0, while that between 03b2 Cnc and 03b1 CMi was 9.4500b0.It should also be noted that already in this first configuration we find a star that is well outside the Zodiac 03b1 CMis latitude was 15.5500b0 south.3 This already supports the idea that Hipparchus accepted the universal character of the rearward motion of the stars.2b08#p23Leo.1) [He records] that the easternmost two of the four stars in the head of Leo, and the star in the place where the neck joins [the head] of Hydra, lie on a straight line.2b08#p24Refer to Illustration 2. Toomer identifies the first two stars as 03bc Leo and 03b5 Leo.The third star in the neck of Hydra is identified by him as 03c9 Hya.The 03bc Leo-03c9 Hya line was 23.800b0 long.The angle at 03b5 Leo was 172.900b0, and the distance to the 03bc Leo-03c9 Hya line was 18.500b4.Although it is not such a good alignment, Toomer has a good reason to identify the third star as 03c9 Hya the description resembles the one in Ptolemys catalogue 201c[2026] the more advanced of the 2 stars in the place where the neck joins [the head] [2026]201d (Toomer, 1984 392). However, a much better alignment is reached if the third star is identified as 03b6 Hya.Not only does it determine an angle in 03b5 Leo of 179.7800b0, but it also 2013and crucially2013 lay just 0.5800b4 away from the 03bc Leo-03b6 Hya line, in Hipparchus times.If this is the case, then the alignments size would not vary much, spanning 24.3600b0 long.Such an identification would go against the natural assumption that the Hipparchian alignments follow the same descriptions for the stars than those given in the Ptolemaic catalogue.4 This variation, however, is not rare even Ptolemy describes some stars in his own alignments in a different manner as he does in his catalogue (Toomer, 1984 322, note 3). To conclude, even if I am not sure that the 03b6 Hya alternative is the correct one, it should not be discarded.2b08#p25Whatever is the correct option, the stars in this alignment were located at both edges of the Zodiac the latitudes for 03bc Leo and 03b5 Leo were 12.2700b0 north and 9.5700b0 north, respectively, while those of 03c9 Hya and 03b6 Hya were 11.1900b0 south and 11.1400b0 south, respectively.2b08 [2026] the line drawn through the tail of Leo and the star in the end of the tail of Ursa Major cuts off the bright star under the tail of Ursa Major 1 digit to the west.2b08#p27Refer to Illustration 3. These three major stars are identified as 03b2 Leo, 03b7 UMa, and 03b1 CVn, respectively.Toomer calculates (Toomer, 1984 322, note 8) that the line passed about 3000b4 from the middle star.By my calculations, it passed 6.5400b4 away from it, in good agreement with the Almagests register.2b08#p28The alignments size is 42.1700b0, and it belongs to the set of extra zodiacal stars while the latitude of 03b2 Leo was 12.4100b0 north, those of 03b7 UMa, and 03b1 CVn were 54.4100b0 north and 40.1200b0 north, respectively.2b08 [2026] the line through the star under the tail of Ursa Major and the tail of Leo passes through the more advanced of the stars in Coma.2b08#p30Refer to Illustration 4. Toomer identifies (with doubts) the 201cmore advanced201d stars as 15 Com and 7 Com.They are indeed, among the brightest stars in a not too bright constellation, the ones that were the closest to the 03b2 Leo- 03b1 CVn line 30.4400b4 and 44.3800b4, respectively.Still, it is not a very good alignment.2b08#p31The total distance of the line was 27.8100b0, and the stars were all extra-zodiacal.2b08#p32Virgo.1) [2026] between the northern foot of Virgo and the right foot of Bootes lie two stars; the southern one of these, which is equally bright as the [right] foot of Bootes, lies to the east of the line joining the feet, while the northern one, which is half bright, lies on a straight line with the feet.2b08#p33Refer to Illustration 5. The two feet are 03bc Vir and 03b6 Boo, respectively.Of the two between those, the southern and brightest is 109 Vir (in a slip of the pen Toomer annotated 109 Boo), and the northern one is 31 Boo.As the Almagest says, 109 Vir lies 1.0900b0 to the east of the 03bc Vir-03b6 Boo line.In modern notation, both 03b6 Boo and 109 Vir have a 3.7 magnitude, so the text seems to be accurate regarding their equal brightnesses. The alignment between the feet and 31 Boo is remarkable the angle at 31 Boo is 179.600b0, and it lay just 1.3500b4 away from the 03bc Vir-03b6 Boo line. 31 Boos magnitude is 4.9, which means that its apparent brightness is 13 that of the 109 Virs.Considering the crudeness of the magnitude system used in ancient times, it is not a bad approximation.2b08#p34As before, this case shows an alignment of a mixed kind while 03bc Vir is at the inner edge of the Zodiac with a latitude of 9.9900b0 north, 03b6 Boo is well outside, with a latitude of 2800b0 north. The total distance of the line is 19.200b0.2b08 ) [2026] of these two stars, the half-bright one is preceded by two bright stars, which form, together with the half-bright one, an isosceles triangle of which the half-bright one is the apex.2b08#p36Refer to Illustration 6.Manitius identified the two stars at the base as 43 and 46 Boo, in Heis catalog (Manitius, 1913 5).Toomer says that he did not track this identification, 201c[2026] since any identification seems utterly uncertain.201d (Toomer, 1984 323, note 11). I think that Manitius identification is correct. Heis 43 and 46 Boo (Heis, 88) are our modern HIP 70327 and HIP 70400.Although they are by no means bright (mags. 4.8 and 4.15 respectively), they are the brightest in the region by a considerable margin, and clearly resemble, together with 31 Boo, an isosceles triangle.The distance from 31 Boo to HIP 70327 was 4.4900b0, and the distance from 31 Boo the HIP 70400 was 4.8900b0, with a difference of 2400b4 between the sides of the triangle. The size of the triangles base was 2.6400b0.The three stars are well outside the Zodiac, with northern latitudes close to 2000b0.2b08 ) These [two bright stars] lie on a straight line with Arcturus and the southern foot of Virgo.2b08#p38Refer to Illustration 7.This alignment is doubtful.Toomer identifies the southern foot of Virgo with 03bb Vir, following the description in the Almagests catalog. Arcturus, HIP 70327 and HIP 70400 form a good alignment, with the angle at HIP 70327 being 178.4400b0, and HIP 70327 lying 3.5500b4 away from the Arcturus-HIP 70400 line.However, these do not align so well with 03bb Vir.The angle Arcturus-HIP 70400-03bb Vir is 170.4800b0, and HIP 70400 lay 1.4200b0 away from the Arcturus- 03bb Vir line, which is 33.7700b0 long.Despite these problems, for the moment Toomers identification is the best extant option. These identifications would render the alignment as one of a mixed kind while 03bb Vir is almost on the ecliptic with a latitude of 0.6200b0 north, Arcturus had a latitude of 32.1700b0 north.2b08 ) [2026] between Spica and the second star from the end of the tail in Hydra lie three stars, all on one straight line.The middle one of these lies on a straight line with Spica and the second star from the end of the tail in Hydra.2b08#p40Refer to Illustration 8. Toomer corrects Manitius, who had identified the three stars as 61, 63, 69 Vir.He proposes, 57 Vir instead of 61 Vir, which is plausible.Such an identification would give an angle at the middle star, 63 Vir, of 172.0500b0, with 63 Vir lying 9.9200b4 away from the 57 Vir-69 Vir line.Another possibility is the trio 53, 63, 73 Vir.That identification would give an angle at 63 Vir of 173.4800b0, and a distance of 63 Vir to the 53 Vir-73 Vir line of 9.3300b4. Whatever the case, it seems likely that the middle star is 63 Vir, which the text tells us was aligned with Spica and the second star from the end of Hydras tail, i.e, 03b3 Hya.The angle at 63 Vir for that alignment was 174.0900b0, and 63 Vir lay 18.6600b4 away from the Spica- 03b3 Hya line.The entire line was 12.100b0 long.All the stars discussed here were within the Zodiac, with the exception of 57 Vir (lat. 10.9200b0 south) and 03b3 Hya (lat. 13.6200b0 south).2b08#p41Libra.1) [2026] the star which is very nearly on a straight line towards the north with the [two] bright stars in the claws is bright and triple for on both sides of it lie single small stars.2b08#p42Refer to Illustration 9. Toomer corrects Manitius identification, and proposes 03bc Ser instead of 03b1 Ser as the star aligned with 03b1 and 03b2 Lib.This correction is completely justified.The two small stars are 30 and 36 Ser.The line 03b1 Lib-03bc Ser was 19.1500b0 long.The angle at 03b2 Lib was 168.9700b0, with a distance of 55.8900b4 to the 03b1 Lib-03bc Ser line.As the text indicates the alignment is, truly, just approximate. While 03b1 and 03b2 Lib were obviously within the Zodiac, 03bc Ser had a latitude of 16.4700b0 north.2b08#p43Scorpius.1) [2026] the straight line drawn through the rearmost of the stars in the sting of Scorpius and through the right knee of Ophiuchus bisects the interval between the two advance stars in the right foot of Ophiuchus [2026]2b08#p44Refer to Illustration 10.Toomers identification of the four stars seems undisputable 03bb Sco for the sting, 03b7 Oph for the knee, and the pair of 03b8 Oph and 36 Oph for the stars in the right foot. The bisecting line 03bb Sco-03b7 Oph had a size of 21.9200b0, and the bisected one, 03b8 Oph-36 Oph, was 1.5600b0 long.In this last one, the section on the side of 03b8 Oph had a size of 0.6500b0, and that on the side of 36 Oph had a size of 0.9100b0, with a difference of 15.4800b4 and a ratio of 0.72 between them.With the exception of 03bb Sco (lat. 13.5300b0 south), all of the stars were zodiacal.2b08 ) [2026] the fifth and seventh joints lie on a straight line with the bright star in the middle of Ara.2b08#p46Refer to Illustration 11. The identification by Toomer of the three stars as 03b8 Sco, 03ba Sco, and 03b1 Ara is certain.The total size of the alignment is 10.9800b0, and all of the stars were extra-zodiacal, with southern latitudes of 19.400b0, 15.3800b0 and 26.2800b0, respectively.The angle at 03b8 Sco was 172.9800b0, and that star lay 18.9400b4 away from the 03ba Sco-03b1 Ara.2b08 ) [2026] the northernmost star of the two in the base or Ara lies between and almost on a straight line with the fifth joint and the star in the middle of Ara, being almost equidistant from both.2b08#p48Refer to Illustration 12. This alignment was probably detected when determining the previous one.Toomers identification of the star at the base as 03c3 Ara (lat. 22.900b0 south) is certain.The alignment was, as the text indicates, only approximate the angle at 03c3 Ara was 174.3900b0, and it lay 10.1500b4 away from the 03b8 Sco-03b1 Ara line, which was 6.900b0 long.The distances from 03c3 Ara to 03b8 Sco and to 03b1 Ara were 3.500b0 and 3.4100b0, respectively. This is a difference of only 5.0900b4, and the stars were all extra-zodiacal.2b08#p49Sagittarius.1) [2026] to the east and south of the Circle under Sagittarius lie two bright stars, quite some distance (about 3 cubits) from each other.The southernmost and brighter of these, which is on the foot of Sagittarius, lies very nearly on a straight line with the midmost of the three bright stars in the Circle (which lie furthest towards the east in that [constellation], and with the rearmost of the two bright stars at opposite angles of the Quadrilateral the two intervals are equal.2b08#p50Refer to Illustration 13. Toomers identification of the two stars 201cto the east and south of the Circle201d as 03b1 and 03b2 Sgr is certain, as is that of the other two as 03b1 CrA and 03b6 Sgr.The only ambiguity lies in the fact that there are two stars at the foot of Sagittarius, and not one 03b21 and 03b22 Sgr.They were distanced by a considerable 19.7600b4.The general direction of the line they determine, however, is similar to that of the alignment under study, so the choice between one of these two does not have a notable effect in the final measurements. I will choose 03b21 Sgr, simply because it is the brightest of the two. The text says that 03b1 and 03b2 Sgr are separated by 201cabout 2 cubits201d.By my calculations, the distance was in fact 3.900b0.If we assume a value of 200b0 or 2.500b0 for a cubit, then the Almagests estimation is about right.2b08#p51The angle at 03b1 CrA was 170.4900b0, and this star lay 37.6900b4 away from the 03b21 Sgr- 03b6 Sgr line.Thus, the alignment (which was 15.0800b0 long), is a very poor one. With the exception of 03b6 Sgr (lat. 6.9400b0 south), the stars were extra-zodiacal.2b08#p52The text also adds that the intervals are equal. I find that the distances from 03b1 CrA to 03b21 Sgr and 03b6 Sgr were 7.0600b0 and 8.0800b0, respectively.This means a variation of 1.0200b0, and a ratio of 1.14.2b08 ) The northernmost [of the two stars to the east of the Circle] lies to the east of this straight line, but is on a straight line with the [two] bright stars at opposite angles of the Quadrilateral.2b08#p54Refer to Illustration 13. This alignment is very close to the previous one.The identification of the third star as 03c3 Sgr is mandatory.The angle at 03b6 Sgr was 175.8100b0, with a distance of that star to the 03b1 Sgr- 03c3 Sgr line of 12.9900b4.The entire alignment was 15.4600b0 long.While 03c3 and 03b6 Sgr were zodiacal, 03b1 Sgrs latitude was 18.0700b0 south.2b08#p55Aquarius.1) [2026] the two stars close together in the head of Pegasus and the rear shoulder of Aquarius are almost on a straight line, to which the line from the advance shoulder of Aquarius to the star in the cheek of Pegasus is parallel.2b08#p56Refer to Illustration 14. The three stars in the alignment are identified by Toomer as 03b8 and 03bd Peg, and 03b1 Aqr (lats. 16.4800b0 north,15.7600b0 north, and 10.7800b0 north respectively).The other two stars, as 03b2 Aqr and 03b5 Peg (lats. 8.7700b0 north and 22.2200b0 north, respectively).The identifications are certain.The alignment is extremely poor.The angle at 03bd Peg was 138.4700b0, and that star lay 50.2400b4 away from the 03b8 Peg-03b1 Aqr line. Curiously, 03b8 and 03bd Peg form a very good alignment with 03b2 Aqr, the 201cadvance shoulder201d of Aquarius in this case the angle at 03bd Peg is 178.1200b0, and that star lay just 2.7500b4 away from the 03b8 Peg-03b2 Aqr line.Given that 03b2 Aqr is mentioned afterwards in the same description, is it possible that in the original Hipparchian list of configurations there were two distinct descriptions that used the same stars, and that these were later conflated into one description in a confused way?2b08#p57The alleged parallelism between the two indicated lines 03b8 Peg-03b1 Aqr (6.5600b0 long), and 03b5 Peg-03b2 Aqr (15.7600b0 long) is notably good, assuming that we are looking at a plane and not a sphere.5 On the one hand, 03b8 Peg is 6.9200b0 away from the 03b2 Aqr-03b5 Peg line. On the other, the distance of 03b1 Aqr to the same line is 7.3400b0.Given the sizes of the lines, this means that they will cross at an angle of 3.6600b0.So, their disposition bears a great resemblance to parallelism.2b08 ) [2026] the advance shoulder of Aquarius, the bright star of the two in the neck of Pegasus, and the star in the navel of Pegasus lie on a straight line, with equal intervals between them.2b08#p59Refer to Illustration 15. There are no reasons to dispute the identifications of the stars as 03b2 Aqr, 03b6 Peg and 03b1 And.It was a fairly big alignment, spanning 51.200b0 long the night sky.The angle at 03b6 Peg was 177.2200b0, with a distance of 39.800b4 from 03b6 Peg to the 03b2 Aqr-03b1 And line.It can be noted that the other, dimmer, star 201cin the neck of Pegasus201d, 03be Peg, determines a better alignment the angle was 178.6700b0, and the distance to the 03b2 Aqr-03b1 And line was 19.1200b4. As the text points out, though, 03b6 Peg is much brighter6, which explains that it was the one used as reference.2b08#p60Regarding the distances from 03b6 Peg, the value to 03b2 Aqr was 23.8900b0, and to 03b1 And, 27.3300b0.The difference was 3.4400b0, with a ratio of 1.14.Again, 03be Peg gives a better equivalence in the distances, with a value of 25.8700b0 for the distance to 03b2 Aqr, and 25.3300b0 to 03b1 And. In this case, the difference is just 32.5700b4, with a ratio of 1.02.However, the identifications are, as I said, certain, and given that the improvement is not qualitative, it is reasonable to assume that the superior brightness of 03b6 Peg explains why it was chosen over 03be Peg.With the exception of 03b2 Aqr, all the stars were extra-zodiacal.2b08 ) [2026] the line through the muzzle of Pegasus and the easternmost of the four stars in the vessel [of Aquarius] bisects, almost at right angles, the line through the two stars close together in the head of Pegasus.2b08#p62Refer to Illustration 16. The four stars are identified with certainty as 03b5 Peg, 03b7 Aqr, 03b8 Peg and 03bd Peg.The line 03b5 Peg-03b7 Aqr was 16.1300b0 long, and the line 03b8 Peg-03bd Peg, 1.5600b0.The two lines intersected at an angle that deviated 2.500b0 from perpendicularity.7 In the bisected line 03b8 Peg-03bd Peg, the part on the side of 03b8 Peg was 0.9500b0, and that on the side of 03bd Peg, 0.600b0, with a difference of 0.3500b0, and a ratio of 1.57.2b08#p63With the exception of 03b7 Aqr (lat. 8.2800b0 north), all the stars were extra-zodiacal.2b08#p64Pisces.1) [2026] the star in the snout of the southernmost fish [of Pisces], the bright star in the shoulders of Pegasus, and the bright star in the chest of Pegasus lie on a straight line.2b08#p65Refer to Illustration 17. The identification of the stars as 03b2 Psc, 03b1 Peg and 03b2 Peg is certain.The alignment is fairly good, with an angle of 177.7400b0 at 03b1 Peg, and a distance of 14.4600b4 to the 03b2 Psc-03b2 Peg line.The size of the alignment was 24.1700b0.The set of stars is of a mixed kind while 03b1 and 03b2 Peg had latitudes of 19.4700b0 north and 31.1100b0 north, respectively, 03b2 Psc was just within the Zodiac, with a latitude of 9.100b0 north.2b08#p66Aries.1) [2026] the advance star in the base of Triangulum lies 1 digit to the east of the straight line drawn through the star in the muzzle of Aries and the left foot of Andromeda.2b08#p67Refer to Illustration 18. Toomer (324, note 26) says that 201cThere is no doubt about the identification of the stars201d as 03b2 Tri, 03b1 Ari and 03b3 And.He is right.He also indicates that the Almagests distance of one digit is too low, and says that he has calculated that 03b2 Tri lay 201c[2026] well over a degree to the east of the line connecting 03b1 Ari and 03b3 And201d.By my calculations, the distance was 50.2900b4 in Hipparchus time.2b08#p68The quasi-alignment was 18.8200b0 long, and of a mixed kind the southernmost of its stars, 03b1 Ari, had a latitude of 9.9300b0 north. The one in the Triangulum and the one in Andromeda were extra-zodiacal, with latitudes of 20.4600b0 and 27.6700b0, respectively.2b08 ) [2026] the most advanced of the stars in the head of Aries and the midpoint of the base of Triangulum lie on a straight line.2b08#p70Refer to Illustration 19.In this case, Toomer proposes two possibilities.The first, which is Manitius, identifies the stars in Aries as 03b2 and 03b3 Ari, and the 201cmidpoint of the base of Triangulum201d as the middle point between 03b2 and 03b3 Tri. The second is presented by Toomer himself (1984 324, note 27), and identifies the stars in Aries as 03bb and 03b2 Ari, and the midpoint as a star, 03b4 Tri.Given that in his catalog Ptolemy puts 03b3 Ari 201con the horn201d of Aries (Toomer, 1984 360), it is possible that Hipparchus had done the same.If this is the case, then it would not be 201cin the head201d, and 03b2 Ari would take its place as the most advanced in the head, followed by 03bb Ari.2b08#p71While Toomer (albeit with doubts) ultimately favoured Manitius identification over this second possibility, I think that his alternative idea is actually correct. Not only it is much better than he seems to realize (he qualifies the alignment it determines as 201capproximate201d), but Manitius is much worse.2b08#p72Manitius 03b2 Ari-03b3 Ari line passes way off the middle point between 03b2 and 03b3 Tri.In fact, it passed 41.1200b4 to the west of 03b2 Tri, the most advanced of the stars at the base of Triangulum.Toomers alternative is much better.Because of the fact that 03b4 Tri has a high proper motion8, it is very helpful to have modern satellite data to calculate a good estimate of its position over 21 centuries ago. In this case, the angle at the middle star, 03bb Ari, was 179.4700b0.For comparison with the previous alternative, in this case the 03b2 Ari- 03bb Ari line passed just 6.2500b4 to the east of 03b4 Tri.2b08#p73Assuming the 201cToomer alternative201d, the alignment was 14.1900b0 long, and it was of a mixed kind.While 03b2 Ari was zodiacal (lat. 8.4300b0 north) and 03bb Ari was right in the limit (lat. 10.6800b0 north), 03b4 Tri (lat. 19.4900b0 north) was well outside the Zodiac.2b08#p74Taurus.1) [2026] the [two] easternmost stars of the Hyades and that star in the pelt held in Orion00b4s left hand which is sixth, counted from the south, lie on a straight line.2b08#p75Refer to Illustration 20. This alignment is a fairly good one.Toomers identification of the stars as 03b5 Tau, 03b1 Tau, and 03c01 Ori is correct.Both stars in Taurus were zodiacal, but 03c01 Ori was outside, with a latitude of 12.5200b0 south.The alignment was 11.0100b0 long.The angle at 03b1 Tau was 177.5800b0, and that star lay 5.6800b4 away from the 03b5 Tau-03c01 Ori line.2b08 ) [2026] the line drawn through the advance eye of Taurus and the seventh star from the south in the pelt cuts off the bright star in the Hyades 1 digit to the north.2b08#p77Refer to Illustration 21. There is no doubt that the 201cbright star in the Hyades201d is 03b1 Tau.It seems certain, as well, that the star in the pelt is 03bf2 Ori.Manitius (Manitius, 1913 8) identifies the star in the 201cadvance eye of Taurus201d as 03b4 Tau, presumably our 03b41 Tau.Toomer challenges this last identification, proposing that we should instead prefer 03b5 Tau.He gives two reasons for this (Toomer, 1984 324, note 29) first, that the description for 03b5 Tau in Ptolemys star catalog puts it as being 201con the northern eye201d, while 03b41 Tau is 201cthe one between this [03b3 Tau] and the northern eye201d. The second reason is that he calculates that the 03bf2 Ori-03b41 Tau line passed about 100b0 to the north of 03b1 Tau, while the 03bf2 Ori- 03b5 Tau passed about 800b4 to the north, much closer to the Almagests description.2b08#p78There are several things to point out in this case.First that the Almagests expression is indicating that the line is passing to the south of 03b1 Tau, not the north.Also, by my calculations the 03bf2 Ori-03b5 Tau line passed, in Hipparchus times, 53.1800b4 to the north of 03b1 Tau, and not the 800b4 calculated by Toomer. Manitius identification is indeed better.The 03bf2 Ori-03b41 Tau line passed to the south of 03b1 Tau (as the Almagest says).The distance is also better, being 30.0900b4 away from the line.2b08#p79However, it is possible that neither of those stars was the one referenced by the text.While the Hipparchian description distinguishes the eyes in Taurus as being one 201cthe easternmost201d and the other the 201cmore advanced201d, Ptolemys catalog describes them as being 201cthe southern201d and 201cthe northern201d (Toomer, 1984 362). This allows for us to suspect that there could be small variations in the details of their respective constellation drawings, at least regarding the Hyades.If we assume that the description of the alignment is referring to 03b43 Tau, a star that is not in Ptolemys catalog but that is nevertheless quite bright (mag. 4.32), then we obtain that the 03bf2 Ori-03b43 Tau passed 5.4200b4 to the south of 03b1 Tau, almost precisely the value given in the Almagest.2b08#p80If this is the case, the alignment was 8.7300b0 long. All the stars were zodiacal.2b08#p81Gemini.1) [2026] the heads of Gemini lie on a straight line with a certain star which lies to the rear of the rearmost head by a distance three times that between the heads [2026]2b08#p82Refer to Illustration 22.The identification of the two heads of Gemini as 03b1 and 03b2 Gem is beyond doubt.Toomers identification of the third as 03b6 Cnc is also certain.The alignment is very good, with an angle at 03b2 Gem of 178.6200b0, and a distance of 4.900b4 to the 03b1 Gem- 03b6 Cnc line. The alignment was 16.5200b0 long, and all the stars were within the boundaries of the Zodiac.2b08#p83The distance between the two heads of Gemini was 4.6700b0, and that between 03b2 Gem and 03b6 Cnc was 11.8500b0.This is a ratio of 2.54, not so far from the 3 indicated by the text.2b08 ) [2026] the same star [i.e., 03b6 Cnc] also lies on a straight line with the [two] southernmost of the four stars round the nebula [Praesepe].2b08#p85Refer to Illustration 22. These last two stars are identified with certainty as 03b8 and 03b4 Cnc.The alignment is quite good, with an angle at 03b8 Cnc of 179.4900b0, and a distance of 0.9900b4 to the 03b4 Cnc- 03b6 Cnc line.It was a small alignment, just 7.7700b0 long.All the stars were zodiacal.2b08#p86Ptolemys configurations.Ptolemy relates, after giving the Hipparchian list, that he has compared the descriptions left by Hipparchus with the layout of the stars in his own times, and that he has found that 201c[2026] no change has occurred up to the present time.201d (Toomer, 1984 325). This supports the idea that precession affects the entirety of the celestial sphere, and not just the zodiacal belt.However, so as to allow his successors to make new comparisons through longer time intervals, he gives a new list of configurations 201c[2026] which were not previously recorded.201d2b08#p87In the following section, I will continue with the analysis as I have done with the Hipparchian cases.2b08#p88Aries.1) The two northernmost of the three stars in the head of Aries and the bright star in the southern knee of Perseus and the star called Capella lie on a straight line.2b08#p89Refer to Illustration 23. An independent identification of the two stars in Aries is not so simple, since the description of the stars here does not fit easily into the way he describes the constellation in the catalog.It is certain that the southern knee of Perseus is 03b5 Per.Toomer prefers 03b1 and 03b2 Ari for the stars in Aries, and given the good alignment they produce there is no good reason to dispute this identification. This alignment was quite big, spanning 48.0700b0 long the night sky.On the one hand, the angle at 03b2 Ari-03b1 Ari-03b1 Aur was 179.5300b0, with a distance of 1.8200b4 from 03b1 Ari to the 03b2 Ari-03b1 Aur line.On the other, the angle 03b1 Ari-03b5 Per-03b1 Aur was 176.9300b0, and there was a distance of 3400b4 from 03b5 Per to the 03b1 Ari-03b1 Aur line.2b08#p90Taurus.1) The line drawn through the star called Capella and the bright star in the Hyades cuts off the star in the advance leg of Auriga a little to the east.2b08#p91Refer to Illustration 23. The identification of the bright star in the Hyades as 03b1 Tau, and of Aurigas knee as 03b9 Aur is certain.The distance from 03b9 Aur to the 03b1 Tau-03b1 Aur line was 22.9500b4.The entire alignment was 30.800b0 long.92b08 ) [2026] the star called Capella, the star which is common to the rearmost foot of Auriga and the tip of the northern horn of Taurus, and the star in the advance shoulder of Orion lie on a straight line.2b08#p93Refer to Illustration 24. There is no doubt that the star shared by Taurus and Auriga is 03b2 Tau.Toomer also identifies 201cthe advance shoulder of Orion201d as 03b3 Ori, a star which the catalog describes as 201cthe left shoulder of Orion201d (Toomer, 1984 383).So, it is almost certain that this is the correct identification, even if 03bb Ori (probably 201cthe nebulous star in the head of Orion201d, in Ptolemys catalog) determines a much better alignment. The angle 03b1 Aur-03b2 Tau-03b3 Ori was 173.7300b0, and 03b2 Tau was 1.1200b0 away from the 03b1 Aur-03b3 Ori line.The entire alignment was 39.900b0 long.102b08#p94Gemini.1) [2026] the two bright stars in the heads of Gemini and the bright star in the neck of Hydra lie very nearly on a straight line.2b08#p95Refer to Illustration 25.Toomer follows Manitius in identifying 201cthe bright star in the neck of Hydra201d as 03b8 Hya. However, given that Ptolemy describes 03ba Hya as being 201cafter the bend201d in the neck of Hydra (Toomer, 1984 392; emphasis mine), I think that he was referring to 03b1 Hya.This option would not only give a much better alignment, but it would also justify him calling the star 201cbright201d while Toomers identification would give an angle at 03b2 Gem of 168.8300b0 and a distance of 48.200b4 to the 03b1 Gem-03b8 Hya line, my identification would give an angle of 174.6300b0, and a distance of 24.1300b4. Assuming my identification, the alignment was 48.7300b0 long, while Toomers and Manitius was 37.5900b0.2b08#p96Cancer.1) [2026] the two stars close together in the front leg of Ursa Major, the star on the tip of the northern claw of Cancer, and the northernmost of the 00b4Aselli00b4 lie on a straight line.2b08#p97Refer to Illustration 26.The identification of the four stars is certain 03b9 UMa, 03ba UMa, 03b9 Cnc and 03b3 Cnc, respectively. Toomer rightfully points out that the alignment would have been good (201cmore plausible201d) had Ptolemy removed 03ba UMa from the configuration (Toomer, 1984 325, note 36).As Toomer suggests, given that 03b9 UMa is to the north of 03ba UMa, the original should have indicated the extreme of the alignment not as being comprised of the 201ctwo stars close together201d, but of 201cthe northernmost of the two stars close together201d. Because the text uses the term 201cnorthern201d or 201cnorthernmost201d several times in the description, in my opinion it is likely that at some early stage in the textual tradition the hypothesized 201cnorthernmost201d in the Ursa Major section was lost due to a natural confusion on the part of the copyist.2b08#p98The unlikeliness of the present text representing the original Ptolemaic description can be assessed by looking at the angles it produces the 03b9 UMa-03ba UMa-03b9 Cnc angle was 136.7500b0, and 03ba UMa was 44.9300b4 away from the 03b9 UMa-03b9 Cnc line. These are very bad results, even for a crude estimation.2b08#p99If we ignore 03ba UMa, we get an angle 03b9 UMa-03b9 Cnc-03b3 Cnc of 179.2200b0, and a distance of 03b9 Cnc to the 03b9 UMa-03b3 Cnc line of 4.4200b4.The entire alignment was 26.8700b0 long.2b08 ) [2026] the southern Asellus, the bright star in Procyon, and the bright star between them (which is in advance of the head of Hydra), lie almost on a straight line.2b08#p101Refer to Illustration 27. The identification as 03b4 Cnc, 03b1 CMi, and 03b2 Cnc, is certain.The alignment is not particularly good, even for an 201calmost201d straight line.The angle at 03b2 Cnc was 146.8200b0, and the distance of that star to the 03b4 Cnc-03b1 CMi line was 300b0.The alignment spanned 2000b0 long the night sky.2b08#p102A possible explanation is that Ptolemy was not originally referring to Procyon, but to Sirius. The Almagest indicates the star as being 1f41 1f1003bd 03c41ff7 03a003c11f7903ba03c503bd03b9 (Heiberg, vol II, 9).If the original instead read 1f41 1f1003bd 03c41ff7 03ba1fe003bd1f77, 201cthe one in the dog201d, then it would be indicating 03b1 CMa, and the alignment would be much better.Ptolemys catalog calls Sirius 201cthe Dog201d (Toomer, 1984 387).The name Procyon literally means before or in front of, the dog. Given the similar names and their associations, and since they are in the same general direction, a confusion by the copyist cannot be discarded.As we will see in the last section, a comparison between Ptolemys and Hipparchus alignments in Cancer may provide additional support for this option.If this is the case, it would be one of just three mentions to Sirius in the entire Almagest.11 By my calculations, in this case the angle at 03b2 Cnc was 174.6100b0, and the distance of that star to the 03b4 Cnc-03b1 CMa line was 49.8900b4. The entire alignment would have been 45.0600b0.2b08#p103Leo.1) [2026] the straight line drawn from the midmost star of the bright stars in the neck of Leo to the bright star in Hydra cuts off the star on the heart of Leo a little to the east.2b08#p104Refer to Illustration 28.Toomers identification of the stars as 03b3 Leo, 03b1 Hya and 03b1 Leo is certain.The line passed 1.0600b0 to the west of 03b1 Leo, and was 31.300b0 long.2b08 ) The [line] from the bright star in the rump of Leo to the bright star in the back of the thigh of Ursa Major (which is the southernmost star on the rear side of the quadrilateral), cuts off, a little to the west, the two stars which are close together in the rear paw of Ursa Major.2b08#p106Refer to Illustration 29. The four stars can be securely identified as 03b4 Leo, 03b3 UMa, and the pair 03bd and 03be UMa, respectively.The 03b4 Leo-03b3 UMa was 33.9600b0 long, and passed 1.300b0 to the east of 03bd UMa, and 56.7900b4 to the east of 03be UMa.2b08#p107Virgo.1) [2026] the line from the star in the back of the thigh of Virgo to the second star in the tip of Hydras tail cuts off the star called Spica a little to the west.2b08#p108Refer to Illustration 30. The first two stars can be identified with confidence as 03b6 Vir and 03b3 Hya.The line they determine was 22.8800b0 long, and passed 38.0800b4 to the east of Spica.2b08 ) The line from Spica to the star in the head of Bootes cuts off Arcturus a little to the east.2b08#p110Refer to Illustration 31.The star in the head of Bootes is 03b2 Boo.The Spica-03b2 Boo line was 56.200b0, and passed 15.2300b4 to the west of Arcturus.2b08 ) Spica and the stars in the wings of Corvus lie on a straight line.2b08#p112Refer to Illustration 32. The stars in the wings are 03b4 and 03b3 Crv.The Spica-03b3 Crv line was 17.9200b0.The angle at 03b4 Crv was 178.7500b0, and the distance of thar star to the line was 3.7600b4.This is a very good alignment.It should be noted that while Toomer and Manitius (Manitius, 1913 10) only refer to the two stars I mentioned, it is possible that Ptolemy was thinking of a set of three 03b7, 03b4 and 03b3 Crv. Not only is 03b7 Crv described in Ptolemys catalog as the 201cthe rearmost of the two stars in the rear wing201d (Toomer, 1984 394), but is also forms a good alignment with the other two stars in Corvus.2b08 ) Spica and the star in Virgos thigh, and the northernmost, bright star of the three in the advance knee of Bootes lie on a straight line.2b08#p114Refer to Illustration 33.This is a very good alignment. The star in Virgos thigh has already been identified as 03b6 Vir.The bright star in the advance knee of Bootes is 03b7 Boo.The Spica- 03b7 Boo line was 30.6100b0 long.The angle at 03b6 Vir was 179.3800b0, and the distance of that star to the line was just 4.6400b4.2b08#p115Libra.1) [2026] the bright stars in the claws, and the star on the tip of Hydras tail are very nearly on a straight line.2b08#p116Refer to Illustration 34. The two stars in Libra are 03b1 and 03b2 Lib, and the one on the tip is 03c0 Hya.The entire 03b2 Lib-03c0 Hya line spanned 24.0500b0 long the night sky.The angle at 03b1 Lib was 178.0400b0, and the distance of that star to the line was 11.8400b4.2b08 ) The bright star in the southern claw, Arcturus, and the midmost of the three stars in the tail of Ursa Major lie on a straight line.2b08#p118Refer to Illustration 35. This is an extremely large alignment, and a very good one.The 03b1 Lib-03b6 UMa line spanned 73.3300b0 long the night sky.The angle at Arcturus was 179.900b0 (just 5.900b4 from a perfect alignment!), and that star was located only 2.200b4 away from the 03b1 Lib-03b6 UMa line.122b08 ) The bright star in the northern claw, Arcturus, and the star in the back of thigh of Ursa Major lie on a straight line.2b08#p120Refer to Illustration 35. With this alignment, Ptolemy produces a nice set of two descriptions that use the stars in both claws, Arcturus, and a star in Ursa Major.The 03b2 Lib-03b3 UMa line spanned 76.2700b0 long the night sky.The angle at Arcturus was 177.0700b0, and 03b2 Lib-03b3 UMa passed 1.1300b0 away from Arcturus.2b08#p121Scorpius.1) [2026] the star on the rear shin of Ophiuchus, the star in the fifth tail-joint of Scorpius, and the more advanced of the two stars close together in its sting lie on a straight line.2b08#p122Refer to Illustration 36. Toomer identifies 201crear shin of Ophiuchus201d as 03be Oph, and the two stars in Scorpius as 03b8 and 03c5 Sco, respectively.The identification seems certain.Thus, we get an alignment that was 22.2700b0 long.The angle at 03c5 Sco was 176.7300b0, and distance of that star to the 03b8 Sco-03be Oph line of 14.8900b4.2b08 ) The most advanced of the three stars in the breast of Scorpius, and the two stars in the knees of Ophiuchus, form an isosceles triangle, the apex of which is the most advanced of the three stars in the breast.2b08#p124Refer to Illustration 36. Toomers identification of the stars as 03c3 Sco, 03b6 Oph, and 03b7 Oph, respectively, is certain.The distance between 03c3 Sco and 03b6 Oph was 15.4700b0, and that between 03c3 Sco and 03b7 Oph was 15.0800b0.The difference between the two sides was just 23.2300b4, and the ratio 1.03 an almost perfect isosceles triangle.2b08#p125Sagittarius.1) [2026] the star on the front, southern hock of Sagittarius (which is of second magnitude), the star on the arrow-head, and the star in the rear knee of Ophiuchus lie on a straight line.2b08#p126Refer to Illustration 37. As before13, here we have to decide which star in the southern hock of Sagittarius Ptolemy is referring to 03b21 or 03b22 Sgr?The better fit seems to be 03b21 Sgr.With this star, we have an alignment with 03b3 Sgr and 03b7 Oph which is fairly good.It had a size of 4000b0.The angle at 03b3 Sgr was 177.3300b0, and that star lay 29.1800b4 from the 03b21 Sgr-03b7 Oph line.2b08 ) The star in the knee of the same leg of Sagittarius (which lies near Corona [Australis]), the star on the arrow-head, and the star in the advance knee of Ophiuchus lie on a straight line.2b08#p128Refer to Illustration 37. As he had done with the alignments between Libra, Arcturus and Ursa Major, here Ptolemy is using two stars from the front leg in Sagittarius, 03b3 Sgr, and both knees in Ophiuchus to produce a set of two related alignments.In this second alignment, the stars are identified with certainty as 03b1 and 03b3 Sgr, and 03b6 Oph.The alignment was 47.3700b0 long.The angle at 03b3 Sgr was 179.1800b0, and that star lay 10.3200b4 from the 03b1 Sgr-03b6 Oph line.2b08#p129Capricorn.1) [2026] the line drawn from the bright star in Lyra to the stars in the horns of Capricorn cuts of the bright star in Aquila a little to the east.2b08#p130Refer to Illustration 38. The stars in Lyra and Aquila are, with certainty, Vega and 03b1 Aql.Toomer gives good reasons (Toomer, 1984 326, note 44) to identify 201cthe stars in the horns of Capricorn201d not as 03b1 and 03b2 Cap, but as the general direction of 03b1, 03b2, 03bd, and 03be Cap, i.e., the stars that Ptolemy locates in the horns in his catalog (Toomer, 1984 375). I am not convinced that Ptolemy would give such a vague reference in his description of the alignment. However, I am not able to give any further argument other than the fact that this is not what he did in any other case.2b08#p131For the analysis I will use as a reference 03b2 Cap, simply because its direction is approximately in the center of this set of stars.Assuming this, the alignment would have been 58.7400b0 long.The 03b2 Cap-Vega line passed 2.0700b0 to the west of 03b1 Aql.2b08 ) The line from the bright star in Aquila to the first-magnitude star in the mouth of Piscis Austrinus bisects, approximately, the interval between the two bright stars on the tail of Capricorn.2b08#p133Refer to Illustration 39. The four stars can be identified with certainty as 03b1 Aql, 03b1 PsA, and 03b3 and 03b4 Cap.The two lines determined by them were 59.0600b0 and 1.7600b0, respectively.The section of 03b3 Cap-03b4 Cap on the side of 03b4 Cap was 1.3400b0, and the one on the side of 03b3 Cap was 0.4200b0, with a ratio of 3.17 hardly an 201capproximate201d bisection.2b08#p134Aquarius.1) [2026] the line from the first-magnitude star in the mouth of Piscis Austrinus to the the star in the muzzle of Pegasus cuts off the bright star in the rear shoulder of Aquarius, a little to the east.2b08#p135Refer to Illustration 40. The stars are identified with certainty as 03b1 PsA, 03b5 Peg, and 03b1 Aqr.The 03b1 PsA-03b5 Peg line was 43.1400b0 long, and 03b1 Aqr lay 56.400b4 to the east of it.2b08#p136Pisces.1) [2026] the stars in the mouths of Piscis Austrinus and the southern fish and the advanced stars of the quadrilateral in Pegasus lie on a straight line.2b08#p137Refer to Illustration 41.There can be no doubt that the stars are 03b1 PsA, 03b2 Psc, and 03b1 and 03b2 Peg. The alignment is fairly good.If we take the 03b1 PsA-03b2 Psc-03b2 Peg alignment (57.5700b0 long), the angle at 03b2 Psc was 177.0300b0, and that star was located 47.5900b4 away from the 03b1 PsA-03b2 Peg line.If we take the 03b1 PsA-03b1 Peg-03b2 Peg alignment, we have an angle at 03b1 Peg of 176.3900b0, and a distance between 03b1 Peg and the 03b1 PsA-03b2 Peg line of 40.0100b4.2b08#p138General analysis.The first thing that strikes the scholar when comparing both lists of stellar configurations is the fact that Hipparchus begins in Cancer, while Ptolemy does so in Aries. It may be that this variation has no special meaning.However, a possible reason for Hipparchus to put the origin of the list in the summer point rather that in the vernal point may lie in the fact that he used the Kallippic Cycle14 as the main reference for dating astronomical observations.Now, the First Kallippic Cycle began with the summer solstice of -329, so this may be an indication that his epoch had, at least in this respect, a greater significance.2b08#p139In my study of the Hipparchian configurations I have noted the zodiacal or extra-zodiacal nature of the stars that determine them. As Evans suggests (Evans, 1998 259) it may very well be the case that Hipparchus discovery of precession came while developing his lunar model.In fact, Ptolemy says (Toomer, 1984 327) that Hipparchus used, as a reference for comparison, the longitude of Spica Timocharis had obtained during a lunar eclipse.Even if Timocharis had used the distance between Spica and the moon as a way of determining the position of the moon, Hipparchus could reverse the method. Given that he had an accurate solar model, he could determine the position of the moon independently, and thus obtain the longitude of Spica at the time of Timocharis.Because the previous reference for stellar positions was the moon, Hipparchus must not have had many positions of extra-zodiacal stars which he could use to check the extent of the precession phenomenon.Thus, his research on this question must have been tentative.2b08#p140However, when we look at the list of configurations Ptolemy preserved in the Almagest, we can see that Ptolemys suggestion that Hipparchus ended up concluding that precession was universal was certainly grounded in Hipparchus research. Out of the 24 sets of stars15 he uses in the configurations that have come down to us, 14 are of a mixed nature.The rest are equally divided 5 are sets of all extra-zodiacal stars, and 5 are sets of all zodiacal ones.In fact, almost 6 out of 10 of the stars the configurations refer to had a latitude greater than 00b1 1000b0.If Ptolemys is a list which is representative of the original work, then it seems that Hipparchus made sure to cover all the possibilities in his research.2b08#p141But, as we saw, Ptolemys role is not limited to recounting some of his predecessors configurations, and checking them in his own times. In a bold move, Ptolemy recognizes the possibility that proper stellar motion may be so slow that even the period between himself and Hipparchus is not enough to detect a variation in their relative positions.His list of configurations is thus given as supplementary material for future astronomers to check this feature.One the one hand, this shows us a rather modern approach on Ptolemys part.On the other, we should not overestimate the importance of this addendum, because Ptolemy had shown that, if the fixed stars were in fact not fixed and had a proper motion, the speed of this motion was so slow that it would not affect the accuracy of his planetary models. He could trust that both the ancient observations he had received16 and the predictions his theories could deliver in the foreseeable future would fit well in his model of the cosmos, even if there was in fact some kind of proper motion.If some future astronomer found this, only minor modifications would be needed to correct his work.2b08#p142As Evans points out, though, these considerations were probably not at the center of Ptolemys preocupations when composing this section of the Almagest2b08#p143201cFor Hipparchus it was still an open question whether the precession was confined to the zodiac stars or shared by the whole sphere. [2026] By Ptolemys time the issue had been settled. Ptolemys aim was simply to give his readers a number of easily checked rough alignments involving bright and familiar stars.201d (Evans, 1998 250)2b08#p144As in many other sections of the Almagest, it is likely that Ptolemy is here just offering enough observational evidence to justify going forward in his theoretical constructions without leaving any relevant issue (like the fixedness of the stars) untouched. In this sense, this section is there mainly due to its didactical importance.That explains that Ptolemy used brighter stars the average magnitude of the stars Hipparchus used was 3.41, with a standard deviation of 1.45.17 In contrast, Ptolemys stars had an average magnitude of 2.5, with a standard deviation of 1.14.This means that the average Ptolemaic star was 2.3 times brighter than the average Hipparchian one. This criterion of brightness likely forced Ptolemy to make his alignments much larger while the average size for Hipparchus was 19.9400b0 (stand. dev. 11.5), Ptolemys was almost double, with a value of 39.9400b0 (stand. dev. 16.87).2b08#p145However, an analysis of the alignments shows that Ptolemys alignments were not 201c[2026] somewhat sloppy [2026] (Evans, 1998 250) when compared to Hipparchus. If we look at the cases which the astronomers described as being 201cstraight lines201d without any further qualification (15 for Hipparchus and 13 for Ptolemy, if we don00b4t count the exceptionally bad case in Hipparchus first alignment in Aquarius, 03b8 Peg-03bd Peg-03b1 Aqr), we find that the average error in the angle at the middle star was 3.500b0 for Hipparchus (stand. dev. 2.98), and 2.2100b0 for Ptolemy (stand. dev. 1.74). The distances of the middle stars to the line determined by the extreme ones were 21.4200b4 (stand. dev. 22.9) for Hipparchus, and 25.2200b4 (stand. dev. 24.34) for Ptolemy.These results indicate that both astronomers, when pointing at alignments as if they were very close to being perfect lines, produced results with very similar errors.2b08#p146Many alignments are nevertheless qualified in various ways, as we have seen. Table 1 shows how these different quasi-alignments were given for Hipparchus.2b08#p147Sign Configuration n00b0 within the sign Qualification Angle at middle star Distance of middle star to line determined by extremes Aries 1 1 digit to the west of the line - 50.2900b4 Taurus 2 1 digit to the south of the line - 5.4200b4 Cancer 1 1 00bd digits to the south and west of the line - 25.5200b4 Leo 2 1 digit to the east of the line - 6.5400b4 Libra 1 very nearly on a straight line (201c03b51f5003b803b51fd603b1 1f1403b303b303b903c303c403b1201d) 168.9700b0 55.8900b4 Scorpius 3 almost on a straight line (201c03b51f5003b803b51fd603b1 1f1403b303b303b903c303c403b1201d) 174.3900b0 10.1500b4 Sagittarius 1 very nearly on a straight line 170.4900b0 37.6900b4I have no answer as to how Hipparchus could give such a bad estimate in the cases of Aries and Cancer. While the cases for Taurus and Leo are very good approximations to the 1 digit value, the other two are off by several digits.2b08#p148The cases of approximate alignments are much better.We can see that an approximate alignment was, for Hipparchus, one that was close to 17000b0.Given that there is a big variation in how that angle relates to the distance of the middle star to the line, it is likely that this second value was of little consequence in the method he used to determine the alignments.2b08#p149Ptolemys quasi-alignments are shown in Table 2.2b08#p150Sign Configuration n00b0 within the sign Qualification Angle at middle star Distance of middle star to line determined by extremes Taurus 1 a little (201c 03bc03b903ba03c103cc03bd 201d) to the west of the line - 22.9500b4 Leo 1 a little to the west of the line - 63.600b4 Leo 2 a little to the east of the line - 56.7900b4 Virgo 1 a little to the east of the line - 38.0800b4 Virgo 2 a little to the west of the line - 15.2300b4 Capricorn 1 a little to the west of the line - 2.0700b0 Aquarius 1 a little to the west of the line - 56.400b4 Gemini 1 very nearly on a straight line (201c03b51f5003b803b51fd603b1 1f1403b303b303b903c303c403b1201d) 168.8300b0 48.200b4 Cancer 2 almost on a straight line (201c03b51f5003b803b51fd603b1 1f1403b303b303b903c303c403b1201d) 146.8200b0 300b0 Libra 1 very nearly on a straight line 178.0400b0 11.8400b4In Ptolemys case, the term 03bc03b903ba03c103cc03bd, when referring to the distance to the line between the two extreme stars, is frankly very vague.We find that it can vary from less than 00bd00b0 in the cases of Taurus and Virgo, up to more than 200b0 in the case of Capricorn.In general, it indicates a fairly large distance when compared to the alleged 201cstraight lines201d we saw before. 2b08#p151The last three cases are dissimilar.While the case in Gemini fits with the average error in Hipparchus, the case in Libra is very close to a perfect alignment it could have been described by Ptolemy as a 201cstraight line201d. The case in Cancer is a special one.As we saw earlier, while the text clearly indicates Procyon as one of the extremes, the error is so big, and so out of tune with the average error, that the Sirius option (174.8100b0 and 49.8900b4) should not be discarded.2b08#p152These considerations about the errors in both astronomers may point to the question about observational methods what kind of instrument were Hipparchus and Ptolemy using when determining these alignments? One could even ask if they were using the same.Pedersen (2010 237) suggests that they used a tout string to determine the alignments.Evans (1998 249) argues against this possibility, correctly indicating that it is very difficult to focus ones view on the string and the stars at the same time, and that 201cOne can actually do much better with the unassisted eye than with the aid of a handheld string.201d During a recent trip to a location with unpolluted skies, I carried out a simple experiment and asked some laymen to find several sets of three stars that they considered to be on a straight line. I then checked their choices and found that the errors very much coincided with the margin of error which our astronomers alignments showed for 201cstraight lines201d. The errors in alignments determined by me also fit into this general range.This is, of course, just an informal study, and a more methodical survey might be carried out in the future to determine more precisely how accurately the unaided eye determines great circles in the sky.2b08#p153Hipparchus influence on Ptolemy some interesting comparisons.Did Ptolemy use Hipparchus configurations in the determination of his own, original ones? Regarding the type of configurations, it is obvious that he was inspired by Hipparchus, or by the subset of Hipparchian configurations he chose to quote.We only find in the Ptolemaic ones cases of straight lines, quasi-straight lines, bisections of one line by another, or an isosceles triangle.In the Hipparchian list we already find examples of these types.So there is no originality in this regard on Ptolemys part.2b08#p154Regarding the star selection, only about 35% of the stars Ptolemy uses were also used by Hipparchus. The five brightest stars used by Hipparchus are also among the stars used by Ptolemy Arcturus, Procyon, 03b1 Tau, Spica and 03b2 Gem.Only the last three were used by Ptolemy as reference stars (Pedersen, 2010 236) in other parts of the Almagest.As was pointed out earlier, though, given his aims it is only natural that he used as many bright stars as he could in his alignments.There are other instances, though, where Ptolemy reused fainter stars, such as 03b2 Psc, which is almost the faintest used by Ptolemy. A comparison between the alignments in Hipparchus and Ptolemy explains why Ptolemy reused it.2b08#p155Refer to Illustration 42. It is clear from the comparison that Ptolemy likely determined his own as a mere extension of the Hipparchian alignment he was checking.Under closer examination, other Ptolemaic examples seem plausibly to have originated during Ptolemys study on Hipparchus alignments.2b08#p156Refer to Illustration 43.Ptolemys alignment in Gemini indicates that a certain star is in the same line as 03b1 and 03b2 Gem. This is parallel to Hipparchus first alignment in Gemini, which does the same.Again, Ptolemys example seems to be an extension of Hipparchus.2b08#p157The following comparison, even if it does not indicate a Hipparchian inspiration, does support the idea that Ptolemy had originally referred to Sirius instead of Procyon in his second alignment in Cancer.Refer to Illustration 44.2b08#p158In red, we can see that Hipparchus determined that 03b1 Cnc and 03b2 Cnc were almost in the same line with Procyon. If Ptolemy, with good reasons, judged this alignment to be accurate, why would he then say that it is 03b4 Cnc the star in Cancer that aligned with 03b2 Cnc and Procyon?2b08#p159Ptolemys study of Hipparchus alignments in Virgo also seem to have served of inspiration.Refer to Illustration 45.2b08#p160As before, the Ptolemaic alignment is nothing more than an extension of the one Hipparchus had left, and which Ptolemy says he checked.2b08#p161Finally, and although it is not obvious, it is possible that a similar case can be found in Libra. Refer to Illustration 46.It is possible that Ptolemy noticed the 03b2 Lib-03b1 Lib-03c0 Hya alignment while checking Hipparchus 03b1 Lib-03b2 Lib-03bc Ser alignment.2b08#p162The subject of this paper has been deliberately kept exclusively focused on the analysis of the configurations themselves, and the relations I could find between them.However, there are several questions which are central to this section of the Almagest and which deserve new research what was the method, if there was any, to determine the alignments given here, or the angular distances involved in the descriptions provided by the text? How are the descriptions given in this section related to the star catalog in the Almagest?What was the fate of the list of configurations within the Hellenistic and Islamic astronomical communities?2b08#p163I hope that this paper will serve as a stepping-stone on which future research can be built upon.2b08#p164Appendix 1.Determination of parallelism.Refer to Figure 1.Let A and B, and C and D, be two pairs of stars that determine lines AB and CD respectively. If they are not parallel, they will intersect at a point Produce lines CF and DG in such a way that they are perpendicular to AB.Finally, produce line DH in such a way that it is perpendicular to CF.2b08#p165One way to determine how far away from parallelism AB and CD are, is to determine the angle 2220CEA.The smaller it is, the closer their relation is to parallelism.From (Meeus, 1998 109) and (Meeus, 1998 125) we know the value of CF, DG and CD. Because HFGD is a rectangle, we know that DG = HF.But CH = CF - HF, therefore we can get 2b08#p166So, we have the right-angled triangle CHD of which we know CH and CD.So, we can get 2b08#p167Then, we obtain 2b08#p168Now we have the right-angled triangle FCE, of which we know angle .So, we can get 2b08#p169Appendix 2.Determination of bisection.Refer to Figure 1.Let A and B be two stars that determine line AB, and C and D another pair of stars that determine line CD. Let E be the point where AB and CD intersect.Finally, determine line AC.If line AB bisects line CD, then .If it does not, then one will be greater than the other.2b08#p170We have the spherical triangle ACE.Thanks to (Meeus, 1998 109) and (Meeus, 1998 124), we know side AC and angles and , that is, a side and two adjacent angles.Therefore, we get 2b08#p171Once we have that value, we can get We also know, thanks to (Meeus, 1998 109), the distance CD."
