This paper discusses both the astronomical and astrological details of Berl. 9825, enumerating its contents and situating it within the broader historical and cultural context of astrological material from western antiquity.The first section outlines the physical details of the papyrus, its paleography, and the layout of the material among the different sections of the papyrus.It consists of seventeen columns spread among four framed sections. The beginning of the papyrus is lost, but enough remains to allow reconstruction of the date and time of the horoscope, in addition to the positions of the missing luminaries and planet (Saturn). A transcription and translation with apparatus and textual notes follow. A commentary in three parts follows the first section.Part 1 contains restorations, confirmations and corrections.This includes both a tabular summary of the data given in the horoscope, and a diagrammatic representation of the data. Part 2 consists of an astronomical commentary, comparing the astronomical data in the papyrus with Ptolemy u2019s Almagest and modern theory, to demonstrate that the horoscope was constructed using tables distinct from Ptolemy's, though of comparable quality.The commentary also includes analysis of solar and lunar data, planetary latitudes, and fixed stars u201cco-rising u201d with the longitudes of the relevant heavenly body. Part 3 is an astrological commentary.Comparisons with other elaborate horoscopes are made, in addition to analysis of the astrological techniques based on the data provided.Because this is the only extant example of a documentary horoscope containing all seven of the u201cplanetary u201d lots of Paulus Alexandrinus, there is a more extensive discussion of the lots used here within their historical and cultural context.Contents n nIntroduction n nText n nApparatus n nTranslation n nCommentary n nPart I: Restorations, confirmations, and corrections. n nPart II: Astronomical commentary. n nPart III: Astrological commentary n nNotes n nManuscripts n nBibliography n nIntroduction n nElaborate horoscopes n nThe surviving corpus of about 350 currently known Greek horoscopes, comprising roughly equal numbers of original documents from antiquity and exemplary horoscopes preserved through the medieval manuscript tradition, is collectively an invaluable source of data relating to the practices of personal astrology and astronomical calculation in the Greco-Roman world.1 Considered singly, on the other hand, few of these horoscopes stand out as especially informative documents for the historian. Most are what we might call u201cminimal u201d horoscopes, recording no more than the individual u2019s name, birthdate, and birthtime and the zodiacal signs occupied by the Sun, Moon, planets, and ascendant at that date and time. A horoscope of this type frequently called for only a small ticket-like piece of papyrus. n nThe remaining minority of horoscopes go beyond the minimal format by providing greater precision in the data, or more kinds of data, or both. Greater precision typically means specifying longitudes of heavenly bodies and astrologically significant points in degrees (with or without fractions) rather than just by zodiacal signs.Additional data may be strictly astronomical, such as latitudes of heavenly bodies, cardines other than the ascendant, or dates and longitudes of syzygies close to the birthdate, or astrological, such as lots and dignities.2 A few types of additional data, for example cardines or house rulers, may appear in horoscopes that specify only zodiacal signs without degrees, but most depended on knowledge of precise longitudes in degrees, and hence only appear in horoscopes that also give that additional precision in the longitudes. n nFour papyrus horoscopes in Neugebauer and Van Hoesen u2019s Greek Horoscopes, all for birthdates within a span of about a half century from the late first century CE to the mid second, exemplify a loose genre that can be characterized as u201celaborate u201d or u201cdeluxe u201d horoscopes (years cited in this paper are CE unless otherwise indicated):3 n nP.Lond. 1.130 (Hor. gr. 81.III.31 = GH 81), 81 April 1 n nP.Lond. 1.98 (Hor. gr. 95.IV.13 = GH 95), 95 April 13 n nP.Lond. 1.110 and Paris 19 (Hor. gr. 137.XII.4 = GH 137b and 137a), 137 December 4 n nP.Paris 19bis (Hor. gr. 137.XII.4 = GH 137c), 137 December 4 n n(Lond. 1.110 and Paris 19 are two copies of the same text, whereas Paris 19bis is a different horoscope with respect to both the wording and the data though computed for the same individual u2019s birthdate.) In comparison to the general run of papyrus horoscopes, these elaborate horoscopes stand out in the first instance on account of their scale, since they are composed as prose texts u2014not mere lists of data u2014that take up more than one column of a length of papyrus roll, while giving precise longitudes in degrees as well as an abundance of astrological data. A hard-and-fast definition of what constitutes an elaborate horoscope is not a straightforward matter, because each example differs in details of expression and in the range of data. A reasonable working criterion, however, would be the inclusion of the planetary rulers of the terms ( u1f45 u03c1 u03b9 u03b1) occupied by the heavenly bodies and astrologically significant points, since these are provided in all four roll-format horoscopes cited above and, when they appeared at all in a horoscope, they would have been frequent enough to be likely to occur even in a comparatively small surviving fragment. Defining them in this way, we can currently identify 26 elaborate papyrus horoscopes, roughly half of which have a preserved or deducible birthdate while the rest are only roughly datable, usually by paleography:4 n nExact birthdate known n nP.Oxy. 2.307 (Hor. gr. 46.3 = GH 46), 46 January 3 n nP.Oxy. 31.2555 (Hor. gr. 46.13 = OG 46), 46 May 13 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4236 (Hor. gr. 63.XI.25), 63 November 25 n nP.Lond. 1.130 (Hor. gr. 81.IV.1 = GH 81), 81 April 1 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4237 (Hor. gr. 84.IX.6), 84 September 6 n nP.Lond. 1.98 (Hor. gr. 95.IV.13 = GH 95), 95 April 13 n nP.Lond. 1.110 and Paris 19 (Hor. gr. 137.XII.4 = GH 137b and 137a), 137 December 4 n nP.Paris 19bis (Hor. gr. 137.XII.4 = GH 137c), 137 December 4 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4245 (Hor. gr. 218.XI.27), 218 November 27/28 n nP.Berl. 9825 (Hor. gr. 319.XI.18-19), 319 November 19 n nPSI 1.23,a (Hor. gr. 338.XII.24 = GH 338), 338 December 24 n nP.Kellis 1.84 (Hor. gr. 373.16), 373 May 16 5 n nP.Oxy. 65.4477 (Hor. gr. 430.VII.8), 430 July 7 n nRoughly dated n nP.Oxy. astr. 4279 (Hor. gr. 50-150a), c. 100 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4280 (Hor. gr. 50-150b), c. 100 n nP.Princ. 2.75 (Hor. gr. 138-161= GH 138/161), 138-161 (reign of Antoninus Pius) n nP.Oxy. astr. 4281 (Hor. gr. 100-200a), c. 150 n nP.Berl. 21347 (no Hor. gr. number), c. 150 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4276 (Hor. gr. 150-250a), c. 200 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4277 (Hor. gr. 150-250b), c. 200 n nP.Ryl. 3.524 (Hor. gr. 200-300?b = GH 250,2, c. 250 n nP.Oxy. astr. 4285 (Hor. gr. 200-300c), c. 250 n nP.Lips. inv. 414 ined.

The papyrus horoscope discussed in the present article, Berl. inv. 9825, meets these conditions to an exceptional degree.7 n nAt present Berl. 9825 is mounted in four glass frames designated A through D (Figs. 2-5).The parts in A (42.5 x 27.0 cm), B (38.6 x 27.4 cm), and C (40.5 x 27.6 cm) were originally continuous, in that order from left to right, and their joining edges are mostly preserved, forming an aggregate stretch of roll of dimensions 119.3 x 27.6 cm. The part in D (25.7 x 26.6 cm) was certainly to the right of that in C, but their edges do not join, though it is doubtful whether much is missing between them.Assuming that the lost column pertaining to the Sun and the incomplete one for the Moon (i) were the same width as the columns for the planets and nodes (ii-vii), the complete horoscope was at least 164 cm wide, not counting margins u2014more if there was an introductory section to the left of the Sun u2019s column. The upper and lower margins are intermittently preserved to respectively about 4 cm and 3 cm from the top and bottom rulings containing the horoscope.According to the records of the Berlin papyrus collection, the greater part of Berl. 9825 was purchased by Otto Rubensohn in 1902 from the Papyrus Fund ; additionally four fragments in frame A (now joined) were obtained as a gift from the Su00e4chsische Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften, and one as part of an exchange with the Giessen papyrus collection. We thus have no information about the precise provenance, beyond the fact (shown in the astronomical commentary below) that the ascendant of the horoscope was computed for a locality on the parallel through Syeneu2014which of course tells us where the native was born but not necessarily where the horoscope itself was composed.The horoscope is written in a neat but not calligraphic hand, consistent with the fourth century dating we will deduce from the contents. Words are separated by, but also sometimes rather capriciously split by, spaces; occasional rising diagonal strokes function as quasi-punctuation marking ends of sentences or sections.Phonetic deviations from standard orthography are frequent, for example u03b1u03b9u2194u03b5, u03b5u03b9u2194u03b9.The text is mostly written out, though with one instance each of common abbreviations or symbols for u03bcu03bfu1fd6u03c1u03b1u03b9 (degrees), u03bbu03b5u03c0u03c4u03ac (minutes), u1f61u03c1u03bfu03c3u03bau03ccu03c0u03bfu03c2 (ascendant), and u03f9u03b5u03bbu03aeu03bdu03b7 (Moon). The horoscope, so far as it is preserved, can be divided according to its layout into four parts, each of which is contained in a tabular framework ruled in red.The first part comprises columns i through vi, and is divided vertically into three roughly equal registers.Each column contains data pertaining to one of the Moon and five planets.The top register gives a string of astronomical and astrological data concerning the heavenly bodys longitude; the middle one gives astronomical data concerning its latitude; and the bottom register gives astronomical data concerning a fixed star in the zodiacal belt that was close in longitude to the heavenly body. The second part comprises column vii, and has two registers, pertaining respectively to the ascending and descending node of the Moon; their contents are similar to those of the top register in cols. i-vi.The third part is a table of ten columns of varying width (viii-xvii) and eighteen rows.The top four rows give data concerning the four cardines; then, following a header row, come seven rows with data concerning seven lots; of the remaining six rows, two contain astronomical data concerning the Moon while the other four are vacant. The last part, comprising col. xviii, contains astronomical and astrological data concerning the full Moon immediately preceding the nativity, further astrological data concerning the nativity, and a closing formula.Part I: Restorations, confirmations, and corrections.The first part of our horoscope is missing, including any introductory information such as the name of the native, the date and place for which the horoscope was computed, the entire section devoted to the Sun, and nearly the whole section devoted to the Moon. Elsewhere some items of information are lost to holes, abrasion, and staining, or only partially legible, and what can be read may sometimes be affected by errors committed by the copyist or the original composer of the horoscope.Fortunately large parts of the text follow a repetitive formulaic structure, some missing data can be deduced from astronomical considerations, and most of the astrological data were derived from the astronomical data according to identifiable rules that can be put into reverse. The first part of our commentary is primarily concerned with restoring and, where necessary, correcting the data relating to the longitudes of the heavenly bodies and astrologically significant points; and the date, time, and geographical locality of the nativity.Further discussion of the astronomical and astrological data in their own right will follow in parts II and III respectively.The longitudes were expressed as zodiacal sign, degrees, and minutes. The other information in the horoscope derived from the longitudes included the following: The house ruler.This was one of the Sun, Moon, and five planets, according to a recognized scheme that assigned one complete zodiacal sign to each of the Sun and Moon, and two to each of the planets.Thus knowing the house ruler identifies the sign itself either uniquely or as one of a pair.Our horoscope is very reliable with respect to house rulers. The terms ruler.Terms (u1f45u03c1u03b9u03b1, literally, boundaries ) were subdivisions of irregular length of the zodiacal signs, each having one of the five planets as its ruler.Our horoscope reliably follows the so-called Egyptian system of terms, which was by far the most commonly used of the several attested systems and which is completely known from multiple sources.If the zodiacal sign is known, knowing the terms ruler narrows the longitude to a range of degrees within the sign. The monomoiria.Each degree of a zodiacal sign was assigned to one of the seven heavenly bodies according to the following scheme.The first degree had the same ruler as the sign taken as a whole, while the rulers of the subsequent degrees cycled through the standard, so-called Chaldean order Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon.Thus if the zodiacal sign is known, knowing the monomoiria limits the longitude to a set of four or five single degrees spread out at intervals of seven degrees. Our horoscope is usually reliable with respect to monomoiriai, but there is one clear instance of error.The triplicity (or trigon).Each set of three zodiacal signs at intervals of four signs forms a triplicity, ruled by one of the seven heavenly bodies for diurnal nativities and another for nocturnal.Since the rulers given for the triplicities in our horoscope frequently conflict with the standard system, we have not made use of this information to establish or confirm the zodiacal signs. The dodekatemorion.This is a variety of scheme that associates either twelve or thirteen equal divisions of each sign of the zodiac with one of the zodiacal signs.The particular scheme used in our horoscope, as we infer from the data, takes the degrees of the longitude, disregarding the minutes, multiplies by thirteen, and counts the product from the beginning of the zodiacal sign to find the sign of the dodekatemorion. The dodekatemoria appear to have been consistently computed correctly.Exaltations and depressions.Each of the seven heavenly bodies has its exaltation in one zodiacal sign, and its depression in the diametrically opposite sign, according to a standardized system.Knowledge that a sign is the exaltation or depression of a particular body determines the sign.In our horoscope this information is reliable. Nearby fixed star.The bottom register of each column of the horoscopes first part names a star that is close to the heavenly body.If the star is identifiable, it determines the bodys longitude within a few degrees.Lots.Lots are astrologically significant longitudes equal to a sum or difference involving the ascendant and some subset of the longitudes of the heavenly bodies.Our horoscope presents a system of seven lots whose formulas are given by Paulus Alexandrinus. The lots determine precise relations among the longitudes.The computations of lots in our horoscope have apparently been carried out carefully.The papyrus preserves complete statements of the longitudes of Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, the ascendant, and the ascending and descending nodes.Saturns zodiacal sign can be deduced to be Aries, which together with Scorpio has Mars as its house ruler and which is the exaltation of the Sun and depression of Saturn. The Moon must be within a few degrees of its mean longitude, given as Cancer 24u00b0 3', and the Sun within thirty degrees of Mercury and within sixty degrees of Venus, say between Scorpio 15u00b0 and Sagittarius 30u00b0.Hence we have the following low precision data for establishing the date of the horoscope: SaturntAries JupitertVirgo MarstScorpio VenustLibra (end) MercurytSagittarius SuntBetween Scorpio 15u00b0 and Sagittarius 30u00b0 MoontCancer Ascending nodetScorpio AscendanttVirgo With the Sun in Scorpio or Sagittarius and the ascendant in Virgo, this is obviously a nocturnal nativity. We can narrow down the possible dates using the usual strategy for simple undated horoscopes, beginning with the combination of Saturns and Jupiters positions.8 Limiting consideration on the basis of the papyruss paleography to years between 200 and 500 CE, and allowing generous margins beyond the sign boundaries, the combination Saturn in Aries, Jupiter in Virgo would be possible for the following years:9 201-202, 260-261, 319-321, 379-380, 438-439, 497-498 For each of these years, we inspect the longitudes of Mars and the ascending node on November 20, around the middle of the span of less than two months possible for the Sun. In a single month Mars cannot move an entire sign, while the Moons nodes shift by less than two degrees.Since we are not testing for very precise agreement, we have used the theories of Ptolemys Almagest to test each of the listed years because of the convenience of Robert van Gents Almagest Ephemeris Calculator for making such comparisons.10 Only for 319 do we find a satisfactory match for both Mars and the node. Taking into account the signs occupied by Venus, Mercury, and the Moon, we can narrow the possible dates down to November 17-19.To obtain further precision, we exploit the formulas for calculating the Lot of Fortune u03bbFortune and the Lot of Daimon u03bbDaimon from the longitudes of the ascendant (u03bbH), the Sun (u03bbu2609), and the Moon (u03bbu263e) for a nocturnal nativity: u03bbFortune = u03bbH + u03bbu2609 u2013 u03bbu263e u03bbDaimon = u03bbH + u03bbu263e u2013 u03bbu2609 This gives us the elongation of the Moon from the Sun, (u03bbu263e u2013 u03bbu2609), as 241u00b0 22', while incidentally securing the uncertainly read numeral for the degrees of the Lot of Fortune. According to the Almagest theories, this elongation was attained, to the nearest equinoctial hour, on November 19 at about two equinoctial hours after midnight for the meridian of Alexandria.For this date and time, we compare data computed by the theories of the Almagest with the papyrus (Table 1).Table 1.Astronomical data computed from Ptolemys Almagest for 319 CE, November 19, 2 equinoctial hours after midnight (meridian of Alexandria, mean time according to the Era Nabonassar) compared with data from Berl. 9825.

Saturns dodekatemorion is stated to be in Taurus; this could only be true for a longitude whose whole number part is 3u00b0 or 4u00b0.The precise longitude can be determined as Aries 3u00b0 43' from the formula for the Lot of Nemesis for a nocturnal nativity: u03bbNemesis = u03bbH + u03bbu2644 u2013 u03bbFortune In the case of Jupiter, the stated longitude, Virgo 7u00b0 40', conflicts with Mercury as the terms ruler (valid in Virgo only for longitudes less than or equal to 6u00b0) and with Jupiter as ruler of the monomoiria (valid for 3u00b0 + 7i< u03bb u2264 4u00b0 + 7i, i = 0, 1, 2, or 3). From the formula for the Lot of Victory for a nocturnal nativity, u03bbVictory = u03bbH + u03bbDaimon u2013 u03bbu2643 we find Jupiters longitude as Virgo 3u00b0 40', consistent with the other astrologial data derived from the longitude.The figure 7u00b0 in the papyrus must be a copying error (zeta instead of gamma).The Moons dodekatemorion fell in Gemini, so that the whole number part of its longitude was either 26u00b0 or 27u00b0. Even at the beginning of this range this would imply an equation greater than +1u00b0 57' where the Almagest gives +1u00b0 41', so we may assume that the longitude was not much greater than Cancer 26u00b0.The data provided for the preceding full Moon provide us with another check on the solar and lunar longitudes.According to the papyrus, the exact opposition took place on Hathyr 17 (November 14) at the 7th seasonal houru2014undoubtedly of day, though the indication of this is illegibleu2014with the Sun at Scorpio 20u00b0 30' and the Moon at Taurus 20u00b0 30'. Since the nativity was roughly four and a half days later, the Suns longitude at the nativity should have been within a few minutes of Scorpio 25u00b0 0', and (adding the known elongation) the Moons should have been within a few minutes of Cancer 26u00b0 22'.With an approximate value for the Suns longitude, we can use the ascendant to get a more accurate estimate of the time of the nativity as well as the terrestrial latitude for which the horoscope was computed, on the hypotheses that the time was a whole number of seasonal hours past sunset and that trigonometrical tables comparable to Ptolemys were used to determine the cardines. For a chosen latitude, we find the oblique ascensions of the ascendant (u03c1H) and of the point diametrically opposite the Sun (u03c1180u00b0u2013u2609) as well as the number of degrees of ascension corresponding to one seasonal hour of night (u03c7).The ascensional difference divided by u03c7 gives the number of seasonal hours past midnight corresponding to the ascendant for the chosen latitude; if it is close to an integer, this is likely to be the correct latitude.

This result implies (1) that the assumed time and place of the nativity were 319 November 19, end of the 7th hour of night, on the parallel through Syene, (2) that the ascension tables were essentially the same as those of the Handy Tables, and (3) that the longitude of the Sun was assumed to be exactly Scorpio 25u00b0 0', either because this was the actual longitude calculated for the date or because the longitude was close enough to a whole number that the computer did not bother to interpolate in the table but merely read of the tabulated value for the nearest whole degree. (If we take the Suns stated longitude at the preceding full Moon and add the Suns progress between that moment and that of the nativity according to the Almagest, we get approximately Scorpio 25u00b0 8'.)According to the table of right ascensions of the Handy Tables, the midheaven corresponding to u03c1H = 159u00b0 5' is Gemini 10u00b0 44'. Unfortunately all that one can be sure of from the papyrus is that the whole number part of the midheavens longitude was 10u00b0 or greater, and that the number of minutes had two digits.Part II: Astronomical commentary.For purposes of comparison with modern theory, we assume (disregarding the effect of the equation of time) that times according to our horoscope as well as according to the Almagest theories are two equinoctial hours later than UT. The time of the nativity derived above is approximately 1.1 equinoctial hours past midnight, and the horoscopes time for the preceding full Moon is approximately 0.9 equinoctial hours past noon.The longitudinal data present in the papyrus or securely restored are compared below with computations for the same dates and times according to the Almagest and according to the modern theory.12 The errors with respect to the JPL figures are in parentheses.

Considering only the five planets, the mean error for the papyrus is u201325', with a standard deviation of 35'; the Almagest mean error is u20131u00b0 49', with standard deviation 39'.The mean error of Ptolemys longitudes is largely due to his defective tropical frame of reference, which is about a degree off for his own time and by the date of the horoscope about a degree and a half off.13 If, as we incline to believe, the longitudes of the horoscope are to be understood as tropical, the planetary tables on which it was based seem to have reflected little error in the frame of reference. On the other hand, the tables for the Sun and Moon appear to have had similar systematic errors to Ptolemys.Perhaps the composer of the horoscope used tables from different sources for the luminaries and for the planets.An alternative possibility worth exploring is that the longitudes in the horoscope are in a sidereal frame of reference.Abundant evidence exists that when Ptolemys tables were used for astrological purposes during the third and fourth centuries, the tropical longitudes obtained from the tables were generally converted to sidereal by adding 8u00b0 minus one-eightieth of a degree for every year since 158 BCE, a formula explicitly reported by Theon of Alexandria as employed by the astrologers of old. 14 For the nativity date, the value of this correction would have been approximately +2u00b0 3', an amount that would more or less cancel out the error of Ptolemys tropical frame of reference. It is conceivable, therefore, that the planetary longitudes in the papyrus look like tropical longitudes in an accurate tropical frame of reference because they are actually sidereal longitudes in a frame of reference that by chance nearly coincided with the true tropical frame of reference in the early fourth century.This hypothesis fails, however, to explain why the longitudes for the Sun and Moon appear to fit Ptolemys inaccurate tropical frame of reference, and moreover our reconstructed computation of the ascendant assumes that the solar longitude was understood as tropical. The synchronization of the longitudinal theories of the Sun and Moon is crucial for obtaining accurate times of94 syzygy.According to the JPL ephemeris, the exact opposition on November 14 occurred less than 20 minutes before the time given in the papyrus, which of course is expressed just as a whole number of seasonal hours; the Almagest theories predict exact opposition about 20 minutes later than the papyrus. A puzzling item in the horoscope is the longitude given for the latitude (u03c0u03bbu03acu03c4u03bfu03f2) of the Moon, Capricorn 18u00b0 3'. Obviously this is not a latitude at all, nor does it have any recognizable relation to the Moons argument of latitude (167u00b0 20' from the northern limit according to the Almagest) or the nodes.We suspect that it represents the longitude of the apogee in an eccentric lunar model.Modern theory puts the lunar apogee at Capricorn 27u00b0 41', while according to the mean motions of the Almagest, this point (which has no direct role in Ptolemys epicyclic model) would have been at Capricorn 25u00b0 29' (error u20132u00b0 12'). Hence if our identification is correct, the error in the apogee (u20139u00b0 38') and the resulting phase error in lunar anomaly of the tables used for the horoscope were considerably greater than Ptolemys.The incorrect designation of this position as the latitude could have resulted from eyeskip in copying a list of data relating to the Moon.We pointed out previously that if the solar tables used for the horoscope gave the same increase in the Suns longitude as the Almagest over the interval between the preceding full Moon and the nativity, the Suns longitude at the nativity should have been about Scorpio 25u00b0 8', and hence, adding the elongation 241u00b0 22', the Moons longitude should have been about Cancer 26u00b0 30'. Subtracting the Moons mean longitude, Cancer 24u00b0 3', we find the Moons equation to be about +2u00b0 27'.Now suppose that the lunar tables used by the horoscopes composer assumed a simple eccentric model, the eccentric counterpart of the preliminary epicyclic model of Almagest Book 4.Entering the Moons argument of anomaly (i.e. the mean Moon minus the apogee), 186u00b0 0', in the table of equations in Book 4 chapter 10, we find an equation of merely +35'. Obviously a simple model, even with a much larger eccentricity, could not have produced an equation of about two and a half degrees.The final lunar model of Almagest Book 5, which accounts for the Moons second anomaly by introducing a rapidly revolving eccenter bearing the epicycle, yields an equation of +1u00b0 36' because Ptolemys special definition of the apogee of the lunar epicycle introduces an adjustment (commonly called the prosneusis in modern discussions) to the argument of anomaly. This correction is dependent on the mean elongation of the Moon from the Sun.The equation, in turn, is dependent on this corrected argument of anomaly and on the mean elongation.Suppose now that the tables used for the horoscope assumed a model that was functionally similar to Ptolemys final model.We may assume that the mean elongation would have been very nearly the same as obtained from the Almagest theory, 238u00b0 37', but, because of the greater phase error, the mean anomaly was 186u00b0 0' instead of 178u00b0 52'. The so-called prosneusis correction, +13u00b0 9', is unchanged, so the corrected argument is 199u00b0 9', and the equation is +2u00b0 32'.Since this is quite close to the value we are looking for, it would appear that our conjecture is correct that the longitude Capricorn 18u00b0 3' in the horoscope refers to the apogee in lunar model in which an eccenter accounted for the first anomaly, and moreover this model also incorporated a correction for the second anomaly in a way not dissimilar from Ptolemys final model. The middle register for the Moon and each of the planets contains a statement about the bodys position and motion in latitude.It comprises three parts: A location statement in the ascent/descent of the south/north (u1f10u03c0u1f76 u03c4u1fc6u03f2 u03c4u03bfu1fe6 u03bdu03bfu03c4u03afu03bfu03c5/u03b2u03bfu03c1u03b5u03afu03bfu03c5 u1f00u03bdu03b1u03b2u03acu03f2u03b5u03c9u03f2/u03bau03b1u03c4u03b1u03b2u03acu03f2u03b5u03c9u03f2).This is probably according to a division of the ecliptic into four quadrants delimited by nodes and northern and southern limits, so that the variables were determined purely by the bodys longitude and the location of the nodes. The latitude expressed in degrees and minutes in a stated direction south or north (u1f61u03f2 u03c0u03c1u1f78u03f2 u03c4u1f70u03f2 u03bcu03b5u03f2u03b7u03bcu03b2u03c1u03afu03b1u03f2/u1f04u03c1u03bau03c4u03bfu03c5u03f2) of the ecliptic.This would have been computed using tables based on a latitudinal model. A qualitative statement about the latitude in the form ascending/descending the south/north (u1f00u03bdu03b1u03b2u03b1u03afu03bdu03c9u03bd/u03bau03b1u03c4u03b1u03b2u03b1u03afu03bdu03c9u03bd u03c4u1f70 u03bdu03ccu03c4u03b9u03b1/u03b2u03ccu03c1u03b5u03b9u03b1) or simply ascending/descending.The trend was likely also determined from the latitudinal model, e.g. by comparing latitudes computed for consecutive days, while the direction, when given, simply repeats information from the second part using a different vocabulary. The Moons descending node is given later in the papyrus as Taurus 9u00b0 40', and, as we have seen, the Moons own longitude was near Cancer 26u00b0 30', so it would have been on the descending quadrant south of the ecliptic.If the maximum lunar latitude was assumed to be 5u00b0 (Ptolemys parameter), an argument of latitude around 166u00b0 50' would yield a latitude of u20134u00b0 52'.Only the whole number of the latitude, 4u00b0, and the indication in the third part that the Moon is moving further south survive on the papyrus. The latitudes and trends (represented by arrows, up meaning northward) ascribed to the planets in the horoscope are summarized below, with comparisons from Ptolemys Almagest and Handy Tables and from modern theory.Table 5.Latitudinal data for planets from papyrus horoscope and Ptolemys Almagest compared.PlanettPapyrustAlmagesttHandy TablestJPL Saturnt+1u00b0 nn' u2193tu20132u00b0 51' u2191tu20132u00b0 48' u2191tu20132u00b0 44' u2191 Jupitert+1u00b0 22'u2193t+1u00b0 9' u2191t+1u00b0 1' u2191t+1u00b0 12' u2191 Marstu20130u00b0 20'u2193tu20130u00b0 1'u2193t+0u00b0 4'u2193tu20130u00b0 14'u2193 Venust+1u00b0 35' u2193t+1u00b0 42' u2193t+1u00b0 34' u2193t+1u00b0 36' u2193 Mercurytu20131u00b0 13' u2191tu20132u00b0 1' u2191tu20131u00b0 41' u2191tu20132u00b0 17' u2191 Saturn was in fact near its southern limit, so that a modest shift in its assumed nodal line would explain why the papyrus has its latitude decreasing, but the indication that it was north of the ecliptic is surely a mistake rather than a reflection of a variant latitudinal model. Similarly Jupiter was close enough to its northern limit so that its computed trend would have been sensitive to the exact placement of the nodal line.In any case, it is obvious that the latitudinal models underlying the data in the papyrus were significantly different from either those of the Almagest or the revised models of the Handy Tables.15 The lowest register identifies a fixed star that rises with the heavenly body. These turn out to be stars in the zodiacal belt, and the principle of their selection seems to have been proximity in longitude, not in oblique ascension; in other words, the composer of the horoscope simply consulted a star catalogue, paying attention only to the stars' longitudes.As we will see, the catalogue was similar or identical to the zodiacal star list in the Handy Tables.The text in the horoscope ( being north/south of the star ) gives the impression that the stated number of degrees and minutes represents a difference in latitude between the star and the heavenly body, but comparison with the Handy Tables list shows that this quantity is simply the stars own latitude. Perhaps u03c4u03bfu1fe6 u1f00u03f2u03c4u03adu03c1u03bfu03f2 ( of the star ) is a confused substitution for u03c4u03bfu1fe6 u03b4u03b9u1f70 u03bcu03adu03f2u03c9u03bd ( of the ecliptic ). u03b2u03b1u03b8u03bcu03ccu03f2, step, as a quasi-unit for the stars' magnitudes (which again simply match Ptolemys) has no parallel of which we are aware; it is unrelated to the use of u03b2u03b1u03b8u03bcu03ccu03f2 for a unit of argument of latiude (equivalent to 15u00b0).16 The Handy Tables list is an adaptation from the catalogue of Almagest Books 7-8 but with many variants in the names assigned to the stars. Instead of absolute longitudes for a specific epoch date, the list gives each stars elongation from Regulus (obtained by subtracting Reguluss Almagest longitude, 122u00b0 30', from the stars Almagest longitude).The stars are not grouped according to the imaginary figures of the constellations but in order of increasing elongation, which is convenient for finding which stars were closest to each heavenly body on a given date. In the absence of a critical edition of the list, we have consulted three early copies, L =Leid. 78 (ff. 142r-145r), F = Laur. plut. 28,26 (ff. 124v-127r), and V = Vat. gr. 1291 (ff. 90v-94v).17 For each of the planets, we give the bodys elongation from Regulus (subtracting the Handy Tables longitude of Regulus for the nativity date, Leo 4u00b0 19' from the bodys horoscope longitude).The stars name as given in the papyrus is followed by the form or forms of the name in the three Handy Tables manuscripts and the Almagest.

Part III: Astrological Commentary This part of our commentary consists of four sections.First, the kinds of astrological data represented in our horoscope will be given.Secondly, a tally will be made of all horoscopes in the extant corpus that include these data.Thirdly, examples of elaborate horoscopes incorporating a variety of data will be compared with our horoscope.Finally, their astrological meaning and context will be examined. Astrological Techniques in Berl. 9825 The astrological significance of this papyrus can scarcely be overstated.It now joins other elaborate (sometimes called u2018deluxe)23 papyri in the extant corpus that apply a number of additional kinds of data (henceforth referred to as technical data ) to the basic horoscopic positions given for the nativity (that is, the zodiacal longitudes u2013 which may include degrees and minutes of the sign u2013 of the planets and luminaries, the Ascendant, and sometimes the Midheaven and other cardines). The information given in the papyrus consists of the following: For the planets, luminaries, and lunar nodes (due to damage, the papyrus lacks information relating to the Sun) Zodiacal longitude Dignities24 (in order of listing): house, terms, triplicity, exaltation/depression Monomoiria Dodekatemorion Latitude Co-rising (paranatellonta) with fixed stars Fixed stars step in magnitude For the cardines: (Ascendant, Midheaven, Setting [Descendant], Lower Midheaven) Zodiacal longitude (degrees and minutes) Dignities: house, terms For the Lots: Fortune, Daimon, Eros, Necessity, Courage, Victory, Nemesis Zodiacal longitude Dignities: house, terms For the Moon only Latitude (apparently an error for longitude of apogee); its house Mean longitude; longitudes house Prenatal full Moon Date of prenatal syzygy Zodiacal longitude Dignities: house, terms, triplicity Monomoiria Dodekatemorion Presiding planet Managing planet Master of the nativity The wealth of information provided by the horoscope is almost unparalleled in the extant corpus of original documentary and literary horoscopes. At present, there are 446 extant horoscopic texts (including our horoscope) surviving from antiquity, as catalogued by Stephan Heilen and including not only Greek (345) and Latin (8) charts but those in Akkadian (30), Demotic Egyptian (51), Coptic (1), Persian (2), Arabic (2, plus 7 unpublished) and Jewish (1).25 Most of these extant horoscopes give only the luminary and planetary positions, the Ascendant, and occasionally the Midheaven, often only by sign, though many include zodiacal longitudes in degrees or degrees and minutes.26 Some include a number of additional technical data (astronomical, astrological, or both) to be used in chart interpretation, in addition to basic information. Frequency of Additional Technical Data in Extant Horoscopes To see how frequently the varieties of technical data given in our horoscope are included in the corpus of extant horoscopes as a whole, we have made a tally of those specifically represented in Berl. 9825, namely: lots, latitudes, fixed stars, the Moons nodes, monomoiriai, dodekatemoria, pre-natal syzygy (new Moon or full Moon), planets presiding/managing, and u2018house-master (oikodespotes).27 Table 6 inventories horoscopes in the currently known corpus that contain technical data, concentrating on those in Greek dated up to the end of late antiquity,28 but excludes our present horoscope in the tally.

The second most frequent category is the prenatal syzygy, with 23, followed by the Moons nodes (18) and the oikodespotes (14). A very few include fixed stars (7), dodekatemoria (7), latitudes (5) or steps (4), presiding and managing planets (4) or monomoiriai (3).We should point out that of the extant horoscopes including additional technical data, most do not include large quantities of them, but concentrate on a few as needed for a specific interpretation. This makes our horoscope even more rare.To illustrate its exceptionality, we shall now look at the commonalities and differences between this and four other elaborate horoscopes of comparable length and content.Elaborate Horoscopes: Examples and Comparisons Only a small number of elaborate horoscopes approach the detail of ours.For a comparison, we shall look at four elaborate horoscopes, pertaining to nativities from the first through the fifth centuries CE (and thus probably composed from the late first through the sixth centuries), that contain at least five types of technical data in addition to the basic longitudes of planets, luminaries and cardines/angles. These include three original horoscopes on papyri and one preserved through the medieval manuscript tradition in multiple copies.Lond. 1.130 (Hor. gr. 81.III.31 = GH 81) This papyrus horoscope is dated to March 31, 81 CE, so was likely calculated in the late first to early second century CE.32 It consists of nine columns and 213 lines, and is completely preserved.Unusually for an original documentary chart, its author, Titus Pitenius, identifies himself in a kind of colophon. It includes the following technical data also occurring in our horoscope: dignities (house, terms, triplicity, exaltation, decan), dodekatemoria, fixed stars, Lot of Fortune, oikodespotes.In addition, it contains information on decans in their Egyptian names, the gender and quadruplicity (tropical, solid, double-bodied) of a planets or luminarys sign, planetary phases in relation to the sun,33 and the number of days of the pregnancy.34 It is similar to our horoscope in terms of length and in the abundance of technical data calculated. There is an emphasis in Lond. 1.130 on the locations of heavenly bodies and the Midheaven in relation to fixed stars or constellations.The wording used for the calculation of the Lot of Fortune is problematic, and has been addressed by both Greenbaum and Heilen.35 The calculation of the house-master (oikodespotes), which turns out to be Mercury, is consistent with the rules of Vettius Valens, Dorotheus and, later, Porphyry.36 Dodekatemoria are calculated (wrongly, as Neugebauer and Van Hoesen correctly note)37 only for the Sun and Moon. Lond. 1.98 (Hor. gr. 95.IV.13 = GH 95) This is another elaborate horoscope containing numerous technical data.Parts of the papyrus are missing or severely damaged; in particular, little remains of what was presumably its first column, comprising an introductory section followed by sections pertaining to the Sun and Moon.The horoscope proper consists of 81 lines.It is immediately followed by a text, large parts of which have been made illegible through erasure, headed Prognostications of the 5 stars [i.e. the planets] concerning life, and comprising 36 lines in Greek and 73 in Egyptian though written in an adaptation of the Greek alphabet ( Old Coptic ). We are not concerned here with this text, which, consisting as it does of extensive statements concerning the life of the native derived from elements of the horoscope, is unparalleled in any other known Greek horoscope on papyrus.Like our horoscope, Lond. 1.98 includes the dignities of house, exaltation and terms, as well as dodekatemoria, latitude, and oikodespotes.Additionally, it distinguishes between bright horoscopes and decans, supplying information for both.38 It claims to have three lots, but these are more likely a reference to places in the chart (the Demotic Egyptian term tny.t, lot, can also mean, in an astrological context, a place, Greek topos).39 Oxy. astr. 4277 (Hor. gr. 150-250b) Dated paleographically (and hence only roughly) to the second half of the second century CE, this incomplete horoscope consists of two fragments, the first with three columns of 40, 35 and 9 lines respectively, and the second containing 5 lines. Included in what remains of the papyrus are the positions and descriptions of Mercury, the Ascendant, Descendant, Midheaven and Lower Midheaven; and the four lots Fortune, Daimon, Eros and Necessity.Horoscopes with these four lots are quite rare in the extant corpus.40 Even as a fragmentary document missing all planetary positions except for Mercury, Oxy. astr. 4277 includes dignities (house, term, triplicity, exaltation, decan), dodekatemoria, monomoiriai, lots, steps and winds, planetary stations and descriptions of the zodiacal signs involved, such as gender and quadruplicity. The Eutocius horoscope (Hor. gr. 497.28 = GH L497) Dated October 28, 497, this horoscope is transmitted complete in two Byzantine Greek manuscripts, Laur.Plut. 28,34 ff. 141v-143v, and Par. gr. 2425 ff. 216v-219v, under the title From the astrological writings [u1f00u03c3u03c4u03c1u03bfu03bbu03bfu03b3u03bfu03c5u03bcu03adu03bdu03c9u03bd] of Eutocius, and abridged in a few other manuscripts without the attribution to Eutocius.41 Its author is presumably Eutocius of Ascalon (fl. early sixth century CE), the author of extant commentaries on mathematical works of Archimedes and editor of a recension (with commentaries) of Books 1-4 of Apolloniuss Conics.42 The introductory passage indicates that the horoscope is offered as an example of how the computation of a chart should be set out; in other words, it is a didactic model that, unlike most horoscopes provided in ancient astrological treatises, is meant to illustrate not techniques of astrological prognostication but rather the format appropriate for an elaborate horoscope.43 It is in fact one of the most elaborate horoscopes we have. The technical data which match those in our horoscope are: dignities (house, terms [Ptolemaic and Egyptian], triplicity [all rulers44], exaltation/depression), monomoiria, fixed stars near the planets (with step, magnitude, longitude and latitude), the Lots of Fortune and Daimon, lunar nodes and prenatal syzygy.The planets are also described by their step, magnitude, longitude and latitude.In addition to these, the chart also supplies the planetary decan and face, and planetary phase of appearance in relation to the Sun. Table 7 provides an easy-to-see comparison between the technical data of our horoscope and those with which it has been compared in the previous paragraphs.Table 7.Technical Data in Berl. 9825 Compared to Other Elaborate Horoscopes.Types of technical data:tBerl. 9825tOxy. astr. 4277tLond. 1.130tLond. 1.98tEutocius Dignities: housetXtXtXtXtX termtXtXtXtXtX triplicitytXtXtXt tX exaltation/depressiontXtXtXtXtX LatitudetXt t tX (but missing)tX Step & directiontXtXt tX (but missing)tX MagnitudetXt tXt tX MonomoiriatXtXt t tX DodekatemoriontXtXtXtXt Fixed stars (paranatellonta)tXt tXt tX LotstFortune, Daimon, Eros, Necessity, Courage, Victory, NemesistFortune, Daimon, [Eros], NecessitytFortune (?)t?

This exposition will provide possible rationales for including them in the calculation of a horoscope.The data to be discussed are: Dignities Monomoiria Dodekatemoria Presiding and Managing Length of life Pre-natal syzygy Master of the nativity Lots Astrological manuals of the Greco-Roman period and Late Antiquity may supply both methods and reasons for the technical data used by practicing astrologers. Often, they are not used in a vacuum, but can be intertwined with one another to produce an interpretation for specific concerns a client might have, such as happiness, fortune and length of life.For our particular horoscope, doctrines outlined by Paulus Alexandrinus, a fourth-century CE astrologer practicing in Alexandria, frequently coincide with those used in our horoscope. A number of them are given a thorough treatment in Pauluss Introduction to Astrology, produced in 378 CE. The works of other astrologers will also be consulted in elucidating the reasons for using specific techniques.For astrologers, horoscope interpretation necessarily involves a number of factors to be synthesized and applied.The Compendium of Rhetorius (fl. probably 6th century CE)46 provides instructions for applying these.It includes seven considerations for the astrological interpretation of a birthchart, especially in delineating the circumstances at birth, the parents, and fortunate or unfortunate life circumstances. Technical data to be considered include dignities (especially triplicity/trigon lords), the latitude of the Moons winds, the position of the new or full moon prior to birth, lots (especially the Lots of Fortune, Daimon, Basis and Exaltation), and the ascending and descending nodes of the Moon.Another text, attributed by Franz Cumont to a Byzantine compiler who excerpted Rhetorius (Par. gr. 2506, fol. 73 and Ven. 7, fol. 170, in CCAG 8.1: 243-244) tells us to examine the decans or faces...the monomoiriai, the bright degrees, the dodekatemoria, and the latitudes of the winds and the steps; the phases, stations and the co-risings of the fixed stars nearest by degree to them... .47 The same document also recommends looking at the pre-natal conjunction or opposition of Sun and Moon (i.e. new or full Moon). Thus, as outlined by Rhetorius, our papyrus gives data for performing a very complete horoscope analysis.Dignities Dignities are frequently added to extant horoscopes, as well as mentioned in astrological manuals. A definition of each type of dignity used in our horoscope can be found above in the astronomical commentary.Dignities are important in interpretation because they allow assessment of the quality and power of the planet involved. They also allow the astrologer to assess the interaction between planets based on their rulerships and rulers.Each kind of dignity can provide more nuance in evaluation.For example, the term ruler of a luminary was often used as a factor in length of life.But the various rulers u2013 house, exaltation, triplicity, term and decan u2013 could also be used to find an overall chart ruler, or the ruler of a specific topic.48 This discussion will briefly give some of the reasons that dignities are used in astrological interpretation, accompanied by the details of our horoscope. 1. House rulership.This is the most commonly reported dignity, and often mentioned in chart interpretation.The house ruler is essential to the construction of the thema mundi, a symbolic chart for the birthday of the cosmos,49 where each planet falls in one its zodiacal houses.The nativity of any person can be compared to the thema mundi as an example of an ideal chart.50 In our horoscope, the house ruler is missing for the Sun (as all details are) and Moon. All other house rulers are correct. 2.Term rulership.In systems of finding rulers for length of life, the term ruler of a predominating planet can become the primary indicator of longevity.In our horoscope all the term rulers are correct except for Venus, which (using the Egyptian system) should be in the terms of Mars, not Saturn. 3.Triplicity rulership.The triplicity lords, especially of the sect luminaries (i.e., the Sun for a day chart and the Moon for a night chart), are used for different purposes, including assessments for eminence (Valens, Anthology II, 2 and 22 [Pingree 1986]) and for gaining happiness, fortune or property (Dorotheus, Carmen Astrologicum I, 24-26 and Valens II, 2). In our horoscope, triplicity rulers are given for eight positions including the lunar nodes (Sun is missing).For four planets these are correct: Moon, Saturn, Venus and Mercury; incorrect are the triplicity rulers for Jupiter, Mars and both lunar nodes.The errors show a tendency on the part of the charts composer to list the diurnal triplicity rulers for earth and water instead of the nocturnal rulers. 4. Exaltation and Depression.The effect of exaltation is similar to that of house. A planet in its exaltation is fortified for effective action, and can aid planets located in its sign of exaltation.Conversely, a planet in the sign of its depression is weak and ineffective, or even harmful.In our horoscope the exaltations are given for four positions: Saturn, Jupiter, Venus and the descending node (the Moons is missing, and no planets are exalted in the signs of Scorpio and Sagittarius, where Mars, Mercury and the ascending node are located). Depressions are given for Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and the ascending node (there is no exaltation or depression in Sagittarius, where Mercury lies, and in Taurus, where the descending node lies).All exaltations and depressions are accurate.Monomoiriai Our horoscope includes data on monomoiriai by sign.Chapter 5 of Pauluss Introduction explains this doctrine (another form, by trigon/triplicity, is discussed in Chapter 32). This process is dependent on the house-ruler of the sign, and the so-called Chaldean order of the planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon).To find the planetary ruler of the monomoiria (which means u2018single degree) of a signs degree, one starts with the house ruler of that sign, which rules its first degree.Thus, for Aries and Scorpio, Mars is the ruler of the first degree.The process continues with the planets in Chaldean order through the rest of the degrees of Aries and Scorpio u2013 the second degrees ruler is the Sun, the third degrees Venus, and so on. For the Venus-ruled signs of Taurus and Libra, one begins with Venus for the first degrees ruler, Mercury for the second degree, Moon for the third degree, Saturn for the fourth degree, and so on.Paulus provides a table at the end of Chapter 5. A scholion for this chapter51 states that monomoiriai can connect (by sympathy ) two planets otherwise unrelated to each other, since it assigns degrees based on planets ruling signs that may not make a conventional aspect, such as Aries and Scorpio (both ruled by Mars). Valens mentions monomoiriai in his Anthology, IV, 26 (Pingree 1986), which seem to operate under the same set of rules that Paulus gives for the monomoiria by sign.Monomoiriai are also mentioned in Ch. XXXV of the Liber Hermetis52 but these seem to be the monomoiriai by triplicity (also covered in Paulus, Ch. 32).In original documentary horoscopes, the calculation of the monomoiria is rare.We find it calculated for the Midheaven, Lower midheaven, Lot of Fortune and Lot of Daimon in one deluxe horoscope, Oxy. astr. 4277 (Hor. gr. 150-250b).53 In the Eutocius horoscope monomoiriai are calculated for all five planets and the two luminaries, the prenatal full Moon, the Ascendant, Midheaven, Lot of Fortune and Lot of Daimon. In our horoscope, the monomoiriai are all correct except for that of Mercury.Dodekatemoria Dodekatemorion means, simply, u2018twelfth-part.It can be used to refer to any twelfth-part of something u2013 a twelfth-part of the 360u00b0 circle, i.e. one zodiacal sign; a twelfth-part of a sign of 30u00b0, i.e. 2 u00bdu00b0; or any portion of 12 degrees.The concept originates with the Babylonians.54 Paulus discusses the doctrine of dodekatemoria in Chapter 22. The doctrine is known in other authors, such as Julius Firmicus Maternus (Mathesis II, 13.2-3), but Firmicus multiplies the degrees of the sign by 12 and adds that sum to 0u00b0 of the sign to produce the dodekatemorion, while Paulus multiplies by 13, which effectively takes into account the actual degree of the sign in question.The Babylonian system, as Rochberg demonstrates, matches what Paulus does: Given a position in the zodiac (longitude [l]1 expressed in degrees (n) of a zodiacal sign (z), a second position in the zodiac (l2) [i.e. the dodekatemorion] may be obtained by multiplying the degrees n by 12 and adding the result to the first longitude [l1 = nu00b0 of z]: l2 = 12n + nu00b0 of z. 55 As an example, Paulus gives Aries 11u00b0. He multiplies the degrees by 13, yielding 143u00b0.He adds that sum to the beginning of Aries: 143u00b0 + 0u00b0 [Aries 0u00b0] = 143u00b0 = Leo 23u00b0. (Effectively 12n + n + z = 13n + z.) Olympiodorus (Ch. 20; Boer 1962: 41.12-20) uses the example of an Ascendant at Scorpio 20u00b0.Multiplying 20u00b0 by 13 = 260u00b0.Add that to the beginning of Scorpio, i.e. 210u00b0: 260u00b0 + 210u00b0 = 470u00b0. 470 - 360 = 110u00b0, or Cancer 20u00b0. (Olympiodorus explains this differently, but effectively this is what he is doing.) The calculation of dodekatemoria is rare in original documentary horoscopes, as we saw above.56 In our horoscope only the sign of the dodekatemorion is given, not the degrees. The dodekatemoria for the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter (for the corrected position of Virgo 3u00b0 40', not Virgo 7u00b0 40'), Mars and Venus match what the Paulus formula would produce.However, the positions of Mercury, both lunar nodes and the prenatal full Moons dodekatemoria do not match what Pauluss formula would produce (they do match the Firmicus formula which also fits for Saturn, Jupiter [corrected position] and Mars). Two possibilities could explain this result.First, the birthcharts constructor did use the Paulus formula, but neglected to calculate the minutes of each position, at least for Mercury, the nodes and the prenatal full moon (the dodekatemorion for Mercury is Gemini 0u00b0 29', almost in Taurus where the text says it is).Since no degrees are given for the dodekatemoria, only signs, this could have been a further truncation of the entire procedure. Or, the charts constructor could have been using the Firmicus formula, but miscalculated for the Moon and Venus.Paulus tells us that this procedure is important for obtaining information about whether someone will be u2018fortunate, long-lived and blessed (Ch. 22, Boer 1958: 46.15-16) or make them u2018laborers, ... unable to acquire property and cursed(Ch. 22, Boer 1958: 46.21-22); such people will also have short lives, violent deaths, illnesses and injuries (Ch. 22, Boer 1958: 46.23). If the dodekatemorion of a benefic falls in the sign of the natal Sun, Moon, Mercury, cardines, Lots of Fortune, Daimon or Necessity, or on the prenatal lunation, this is said to be fortunate, but when a malefics dodekatemorion falls there, the effects are unfortunate.Presiding and Managing Few authors except for Paulus mention the concept of presiding and managing.The earliest appears to be Serapion, in a text on katarchai.57 Antiochus of Athens58 gives outcomes for those born when certain hour rulers manage during a day, usually based on whether the planetary ruler is a benefic or malefic. Another text, by Zenarion (about whom nothing further is known) also uses the technique in katarchic charts.59 In Chapter 21, On the Star Presiding and the One Managing Paulus outlines the technique and promotes its use both in nativities and katarchai.He further approves its use in decumbitures, a chart cast for when an ill person takes to his or her bed.Pauluss method depends, first, on finding the god ruling over the day in question (Ch. 20, u2018On Knowing to which of the Gods Each Day Belongs). This is the god traditionally assigned to each day of the week.Thus, if the day in question is a Sunday, the Sun is the god of the day.Once the god (i.e. planet) of the day is known, that planet presides over the entire 24-hour day, which is sectioned into 12 day and 12 night hours.60 The presiding planet rules the 1st, 8th, 15th and 22nd hours of that day.The hour rulers are assigned in the so-called Chaldean order from the presiding planet, and become the u2018managers of that hour, beginning with the first hour of the day. Olympiodorus, Pauluss commentator, covers the same material (Ch. 18).As an example, the well-known katarchic horoscope for the crowning of Leontius at Antioch (Hor. gr. 484.VII.18 = GH L484), lists Mercury as u03c0u03bfu03bbu03b5u03c5u0301u03c9u03bd and u03b4u03b9u03b5u0301u03c0u03c9u03bd, and uses this as the reason the chart was not successful: but they [the astrologers] did not pay attention, first, that the presiding and managing [planet], Mercury, had fallen into misfortune (u03b5u1f30u03c2 u03c0u03b1u0301u03b8u03bfu03c2). For it was at its greatest [distance] from the Sun, which brings about violent death, and it was aspected only by Saturn. 61 Only three other extant horoscopes include this technique: all are from literary sources, with dates in the fifth century CE (Hor. gr. 475.VII.16 = GH L475, Hor. gr. 479.VII.14 = GH L479, and 487.IX.5 = GH L487, the last of which mentions only the managing ruler).In our horoscope, the planets presiding and managing are listed as Jupiter and Saturn. These would be correct if this was a diurnal chart for the 7th hour of the day of 319 CE, November 19, but this horoscope is nocturnal and belongs to the night preceding the day of November 19.62 In the system outlined by Paulus, and also mentioned by Vettius Valens, an anonymous Christian writer on the hours of the day of the week, and Cassius Dio,63 the 24-hour day begins at sunrise with the planetary day hours. This is the usual epoch for this system, probably arising from the fact that the Hellenistic Egyptians began the day at sunrise.But other epochs were also in use, in which the 24-hour day could begin at sunset.64 Neugebauer and Van Hoesen mention horoscopes in the fourth century that use an evening epoch, and a calendar of 354 CE does as well.65 So it seems that the author of our horoscope was using an evening epoch with the Alexandrian calendar, where the day begins at sunset, and begins it by applying the usual rulers of the day hours to this evening epoch. Even though it was still Wednesday, November 18, in a day epoch (where the presiding planet would be Mercury and the managing planet, Mars, rules the 7th hour), in an evening epoch the presiding planet would be Jupiter (the presiding planet for Thursday November 19, 319), and the planet managing the 7th hour is Saturn.Because the beginning of the text is lost, we cannot know for certain how the author dated it. But this explanation seems plausible based on our knowledge of the use of epochs in this timeframe.Though it does contradict the common practice of planetary days and hours outlined by Paulus, the author was not necessarily incorrect in using the day rulers for an evening epoch, even if he was unorthodox.Length of Life: Master of the Nativity and the Prenatal Syzygy Although we have no way of knowing how the author of our chart planned to use the calculated information, discovering length of life is an important consideration addressed by ancient astrologers. Aside from the use of term rulers, two of the techniques used to determine this are included in our chart: the housemaster/master of the nativity, and the prenatal syzygy.Master of the Nativity This is yet another technique mentioned by Paulus in his Introduction.Chapter 36, On Housemastership (u03a0u03b5u03c1u1f76 u03bfu03b9u0313u03bau03bfu03b4u03b5u03c3u03c0u03bfu03c4u03b5u03b9u0301u03b1u03c2), provides the conditions under which a planet may become the chart ruler (or, to use Pauluss term, the u03bau03c5u0301u03c1u03b9u03b1 u03c4u1fc6u03c2 u03b3u03b5u03bdu03b5u0301u03c3u03b5u03c9u03c2, authority of the nativity). The Sun and Moon are most important in this process, the Sun being used in a day chart, but the Moon at night.In a nocturnal chart, as ours is, one looks at the term-ruler and house-steward (u03bfu03b9u0313u03bau03bfu03b4u03b5u0301u03bau03c4u03c9u03c1) of the Moon, and then at whether the Sun or Moon (depending on the sect of the chart) are in u2018effective places.At night, the effective places are the four cardines, the fifth (Good Fortune), eleventh (Good Daimon), second and eighth. Let us apply these rules to our papyrus.In a nocturnal nativity, we look at the Moon.We know that the Ascendant is Virgo 10u00b0 57', and that the Moon is likely to fall between 24u00b0 (roughly its mean position) and 27u00b0 Cancer.Using the whole-sign place system, the Moon will fall in the 11th place, that of the Good Daimon, which is an effective place.The term-ruler for the Moon at 26u00b0 Cancer is still Jupiter, but in the next degree moves to Saturn in the Egyptian system. That the horoscope gives Jupiter as the u2018master of the nativity would therefore suggest a position of around 26u00b0 for the Moon (as also suggested in Part I of this commentary).The house-steward of the Moon in Cancer is, of course, the Moon.Jupiter is also in an effective place, the first (including the entire sign of Virgo as the first place).So far it seems that the Moon and Jupiter have equal claim on rulership. Then Paulus says when one star has more counts than the others and is found at morning rising [in a phase of visibility] on a cardine and in its own throne, this one has the rulership, especially if it oversees (u03bau03b1u03c4u03bfu03c0u03c4u03b5u03c5u0301u03c9) the sect luminary. 66 Jupiter has no counts of rulership in the early degrees of Virgo (in fact, its depression is Virgo).It sextiles the Moon, the sect luminary, by sign (but in fact, by degree makes no aspect). (It also sextiles the other luminary, the Sun, by sign.) It is in a phase of visibility, and would appear in the eastern sky before the sun rises. It is also in a cardine, the Ascendant/first place.By contrast, the Moon is in its own house and face, which would give it two counts to Jupiters zero.It is not on a cardine, but it is the sect luminary.This would seem to give the Moon an edge over Jupiter.Further, since both Jupiter and the Moon are in effective places, and Paulus says that if a luminary is in an effective place it becomes the ruler, it would seem that the Moon should have been chosen. However, it may be that the astrologer has (incorrectly) moved to Pauluss next condition: examining the term-ruler, triplicity lord or house-steward of the prenatal Full Moon (for a nocturnal birth).The Prenatal Syzygy The preceding full Moon took place at Taurus 20u00b0 30'.This is the house of Venus, the term of Jupiter and the triplicity of the Moon.This position falls, however, in the ninth place, not usually considered an effective place (although it is a good decline and the place of the Sun god).67 If the prenatal full Moon is not in an effective place, Paulus says, one must look at the triplicity, house and term rulers of the Lots of Fortune or Daimon; and also the lord of the Ascendant. The Lot of Fortune falls in the 10th degree of Capricorn: triplicity of the Moon, house of Saturn and term of Jupiter.The Lot of Daimon falls in the 13th degree of Taurus: triplicity of the Moon, house of Venus, term of Mercury.The lord of the Ascendant is Mercury.We know that the Moon and Jupiter are in effective places; Saturn is in the eighth (effective), Venus in the second (also effective) and Mercury in the fourth (effective). u2018And if the one ruling these places is found being aspected in the aforegiven places with that one which it has received, it will be taken as the authority of the nativity.68 In our chart, the Moon opposes Fortune by sign, Saturn squares it and Jupiter trines it. The Moon sextiles Daimon by sign, makes no aspect to Venus (but both are in Venus-ruled signs) and no aspect to Mercury.Mercury squares the Ascendant.There seems to be no clear winner here.Jupiter is not particularly dominant; it is only the term ruler of the Lot of Fortune.Although it is in an effective place and trines Fortune, this rationale seems weak for giving it the rulership instead of the Moon. For Venus sharing the rulership, there are the following considerations.Venus is in its own house.It is in a phase of visibility (rising before the sun and not combust).It is in an effective place (the 2nd) in a nocturnal horoscope, according to Paulus.However, it is still something of a mystery as to why the astrologer chose Jupiter as the master of the nativity, unless the fact that it was well placed in the Ascendant, well ahead of the sun and in a phase of visibility, is the term ruler of the prenatal full Moon and aspects both the luminaries and the Lot of Fortune, gives it more advantages than the equally well-placed and more dignified Moon. Lots Lots have an oversized presence in our horoscope: seven lots are prominently featured.Our horoscope is the earliest, and only original documentary, chart to contain so many lots.69 Using the formulae of Paulus, they are calculated by degree and minute, and supplied with both their house and term ruler.More exclusively, then, than the other techniques supplied in this horoscope, these lots are directly associated with Paulus Alexandrinus. Besides his later commentator Olympiodorus, he is the only author in the extant corpus to provide formulae for these lots.His chapter on lots mentions each by name, with its formula, and associates it with a planet: Suitably, the lots have this origin: since by nature the Moon is set down as Fortune, the Sun Daimon, Aphrodite Eros, the [star] of Hermes Necessity, that of Ares Courage, that of Zeus Victory, and that of Kronos Nemesis. 70 This order matches the listing of the lots in our horoscope. Pauluss commentator, Olympiodorus (writing in 564 CE),71 spells out the direct connection of each lot to a celestial body: ...7 lots owing to the number of the 7 stars. 72 At present this is the only documentary horoscope to contain all of the planetary lots that Paulus describes, using the formulae he provides.In literary horoscopes, one rather corrupt text associated with Olympiodorus likely calculates the Lot of Eros according to Pauluss formula.73 No other documentary or literary horoscope up to the end of Late Antiquity uses any of Pauluss lot formulae for the Lots of Eros, Necessity, Courage, Victory or Nemesis. In the Arabic period, a horoscope transmitted by Abu016b Mau2018shar includes the Lots of Courage and Victory, and a lot called Intellect and Native Wit, the formula of which is identical to the Paulus formula for the Lot of Necessity.74 Finally, a nativity calculated for September 3, 905 CE, calculates, among others, the Lots of Fortune, Daimon and Eros.75 But the calculation for the Lot of Eros does not use Pauluss formula.76 The Planetary Lots in Context Prior to the discovery of this horoscope, only one literary and no documentary horoscopes contained the Lots of Eros and/or Necessity using Pauluss formulae, and none before the end of Late Antiquity contained the Lots of Courage, Victory or Nemesis. Our horoscope is unique within the extant corpus in containing all seven lots as described, with formulae and meanings, by Paulus.Before Paulus, who was writing in 378 CE,77 the Lots of Fortune and (less so) Daimon appear somewhat regularly in documentary and literary horoscopes, as well as (albeit rarely) the Lots of Eros and Necessity.78 Vettius Valens and Firmicus Maternus are the main authors who discuss interpretation and provide formulae for these four lots. However, the formulae they use for the Lots of Eros and Necessity are not those that Paulus specifies in his astrological treatise.79 Thus, before the fourth century CE, no documentary evidence exists for use of the Paulus formulae, and no calculation of the Lots of Courage, Victory or Nemesis.In astrological texts said to antedate Paulus, only Antiochus of Athens provides a short section on these lots (see below). Previous work on lots has posited two traditions of calculation for the lots of Eros and Necessity.80 One tradition may be designated Hermetic, after the assertion by Olympiodorus and a scholiast for Paulus that these lots derive from a book by Hermes Trismegistus called the Panaretos.81 The other tradition is called Egyptian, drawing on a scholion to a passage in Hephaestios Apotelesmatika III, 6.11, describing two methods for casting the Lots of Necessity and Eros according to Hermes Trismegistus or, just as in the 4th book, Dorotheus gives an account of the opinion of the Egyptians. 82 This scholion thus supplies evidence of two lot traditions for these lots in antiquity. One of Pauluss passages on the planetary lots has a number of similarities to a passage that the later compiler Rhetorius claims are from the Thesaurus of Antiochus of Athens, whose probable floruit was the second century CE.Antiochus associates a planet or luminary with each lot, but gives no formula to calculate them, or an origin (we can assume they are the same lots Paulus describes because of the similar wording).83 Possibly Paulus and Antiochus drew on a similar source, or Paulus was the first to come across this passage by Antiochus, because no other author in the extant literature before 378 CE mentions such lots. In the second century, Vettius Valens specifically associates the Lots of Fortune, Daimon, Eros and Necessity with several astrological techniques (e.g.Anthology II 37, IV 4-10, 25 [Pingree 1986]), but does not use the Paulus formulae and does not mention any other planetary lots.Pauluss near contemporary, Firmicus Maternus, mentions a Lot of Nemesis along with his versions of the Lots of Eros and Necessity (Mathesis, VI.32), but his formulae for them also do not match Pauluss. It should be emphasized that Paulus himself does not mention Hermes as the originator of these lots, nor does the word Panaretos appear anywhere in his text, but only in the title of Chapter 23.The word panaretos means all-virtuous.In the extant corpus of Greek works, its association to a book, as in the phrase u03c0u03b1u03bdu03b1u03c1u03b5u0301u03c4u03bfu03c2 u03b2u03b9u0301u03b2u03bbu03bfu03c2 (or variants) is rare.Panaretos does not appear in reference to a book until the fourth century CE. The phrase u03c0u03b1u03bdu03b1u03c1u03adu03c4u1ff3 u03b2u03afu03b2u03bbu1ff3 appears in Pap.Mag.Leid. J 395 (PGM XIII.981-982) where it is associated with Ptolemaica. 84 Its association with Hermes Trismegistus appears only in the Paulus-connected texts.Other uses of the word Panaretos appear to be restricted to later ecclesiastical writings (there is mention in the fourth century of a Panaretos on the wisdom of Solomon).85 It does not seem to have anything to do with the astrological Panaretos. It is difficult to judge the date of the Panaretos.No extant texts earlier than the fourth century mention it.One could assume, as the Gundels did, that any Hermetic text would likely have been written around the 2nd century BCE.86 But that any mention of the Panaretos does not arise until the fourth century suggests that the text was unknown before then.It may have been discovered during that time. In addition, Paulus does not mention Hermes Trismegistus as the author.Perhaps Olympiodorus attached the name of Hermes to the text to give it authenticity, or the text did have the name of Hermes attached to it (but this was not noted until the Olympiodorus commentary).In any case, Berl. 9825, containing the chart of a birth in 319, fits into this fourth-century timeframe.Because of the uncertainty surrounding the origins of these lots, it is testamentary evidence of the work of Paulus Alexandrinus, as well as an exclusive and important witness to the use of all the planetary lots in practice. Conclusions This horoscope undoubtedly ranks among the most comprehensive of antiquity.The amount of technical data it includes puts it near, if not at the top, of elaborate horoscopes of antiquity.It is significant both astronomically and astrologically.Astrologically, it is an astounding example of the variety of technical data and methods used by astrologers in late antiquity.As this astrological commentary has shown, a number of the techniques included in our horoscopes data have been covered by Paulus Alexandrinus in his Introduction. Among his specialties, dodekatemoria, monomoiriai, presiding and managing planets and, especially, planetary lots, whose formulae Paulus is the first to delineate, appear in our papyrus.While it is highly unlikely that a definitive author of this horoscope will ever be known, these connections to Paulus and his work provoke some further attention.The timeframe of 319 easily falls within Pauluss lifetime (he wrote the Introduction in 378 CE). That the horoscope was cast for the latitude of Syene, in Upper Egypt, suggests an Egyptian link, and Paulus was known to have practiced astrology in Alexandria. A compelling piece of evidence is, of course, the seven planetary lots calculated with the formulae described first by Paulus (and, during Late Antiquity, later taken up only by his commentator Olympiodorus).It is possible, then, that the horoscope was calculated by someone following the practices of Paulus as a student, perhaps practicing the calculation of multiple techniques as a student exercise.87 Equally, we have no way of knowing whose chart was calculated. Source: P.Berl. 9825: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance.Although the date of birth falls in the correct timeframe for Paulus himself, and there are examples of astrologers casting their own horoscopes both for personal use and as a teaching tool,88 it goes beyond the bounds of speculation to suggest that the horoscope could be his.Though any final certainty is unlikely, the tantalizing authorial hints we obtain from this birthchart make it an even more unusual and important example of a late antique horoscope.
